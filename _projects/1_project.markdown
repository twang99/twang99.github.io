Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe, which consist of hundreds to thousands of galaxies 
with total masses (including galaxies, intracluster medium, and dark matter) ranging from $$10^{14}-10^{15}$$ solar masses.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    <img class="col three left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>

<div class="col three caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above:

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two left" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
</div>
