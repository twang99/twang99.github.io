<strong>Context<strong>

Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe, which consist of hundreds to thousands of galaxies 
with total masses (including galaxies, intracluster medium, and dark matter) ranging from $$10^{14}-10^{15}$$ solar masses. 


Formation of the first galaxy clusters.
How does the local environment of galaxies affect their formation and evolution across cosmic time?
Origin of the intracluster light.
