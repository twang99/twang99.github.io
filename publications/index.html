    <p>We report detections of two 1.2 mm continuum sources (S _1.2 mm
        \ensuremath∼ 0.6 mJy) without any counterparts in the
        deep H- and/or K-band image (i.e., K-band magnitude
        \ensuremath≳26 mag). These near-infrared-dark faint
        millimeter sources are uncovered by ASAGAO, a deep and wide-
        field (≃26 arcmin^2) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
        Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm survey. One has a red IRAC (3.6 and 4.5
        \ensuremathμm) counterpart, and the other has been
        independently detected at 850 and 870 \ensuremathμm using
        SCUBA2 and ALMA Band 7, respectively. Their optical-to-radio
        spectral energy distributions indicate that they can lie at z
        \ensuremath≳ 3─5 and can be in the early phase of
        massive galaxy formation. Their contribution to the cosmic star
        formation rate density is estimated to be \ensuremath∼1
        \texttimes 10^\ensuremath-3 M _☉
        yr^\ensuremath-1 Mpc^\ensuremath-3 if they lie
        somewhere in the redshift range of z \ensuremath∼ 3─5.
        This value can be consistent with, or greater than, that of
        bright submillimeter galaxies (S _870 \ensuremathμm
        &gt; 4.2 mJy) at z \ensuremath∼ 3─5. We also uncover
        three more candidate near-infrared-dark faint ALMA sources
        without any counterparts (S _1.2 mm \ensuremath∼
        0.45─0.86 mJy). These results show that an unbiased ALMA survey
        can reveal the dust-obscured star formation activities, which
        were missed in previous deep optical/near-infrared surveys.</p>

    <p>We present a measurement of the spatial clustering of rest-frame UV-
        selected massive galaxies at 0.5 \ensuremath≤ z
        \ensuremath≤ 2.5 in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field.
        Considering four separate redshift bins with
        \ensuremath∆z = 0.5, we construct three galaxy
        populations, i.e., red sequence (RS), blue cloud (BC), and green
        valley (GV) galaxies, according to their rest-frame extinction-
        corrected UV colors. The correlation lengths of these
        populations are confirmed to be dependent on their rest-frame UV
        color and redshift: UV redder galaxies are found to be more
        clustered. In all redshift bins, the GV galaxies generally have
        medium clustering amplitudes and are hosted within dark matter
        halos whose masses are more or less between those of RS and BC
        galaxies; and the clustering amplitude of GV galaxies is close
        to that of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the same redshift
        bin, suggesting that AGN activity may be responsible for
        transforming galaxy colors. After carefully examining their
        stellar masses, we find that the clustering amplitudes of galaxy
        samples with different colors are all similar once they have a
        similar median stellar mass and that the median stellar mass
        alone may be a good predictor of galaxy clustering.</p>

    <p>We present high-fidelity, 30 milliarcsecond (200-pc) resolution ALMA
        rest-frame 240 \mum observations of cold dust emission in
        three typical z ∼3 star-forming galaxies in the Hubble
        Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF). The cold dust is distributed within the
        smooth disk-like central regions of star formation (SF) 1 - 3
        kpc in diameter, despite their complex and disturbed rest-frame
        UV and optical morphologies. No dust substructures or clumps are
        seen down to ≃1- 3 M_\odotyr^-1 (1σ) per
        200-pc beam. No dust emission is observed at the locations of
        UV-emitting clumps, which lie ≃2-10 kpc from the bulk of
        SF. Clumpy substructures can contribute no more than 1-8 %
        (3σupper limits) of the total SF in these galaxies. The
        lack of SF substructures in our HUDF galaxies is to be
        contrasted with the multiple substructures characteristic of
        submillimeter-selected galaxies (SMGs) at the same cosmic epoch,
        each containing ∼10-30 % of their total SF. We find that
        individual substructures of SMGs are often as bright in the far-
        infrared as (or in some cases brighter than) our HUDF galaxies,
        suggesting that these SMGs originate from a class of disruptive
        event involving multiple objects at the scale of our HUDF
        galaxies. The scale of the disruptive event found in our HUDF
        galaxies, characterized by the lack of star-forming
        substructures at our resolution and sensitivity, could be less
        violent, e.g., gas-rich disk instability or minor mergers.</p>

    <p>We investigate the X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) properties of
        millimeter galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep
        Survey South (GOODS-S) field detected with the Atacama Large
        Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), by utilizing the Chandra
        7-Ms data, the deepest X-ray survey to date. Our millimeter
        galaxy sample comes from the ASAGAO survey covering 26
        arcmin^2 (12 sources at a 1.2 mm flux-density limit of
        \ensuremath≈ 0.6 mJy), supplemented by the deeper but
        narrower 1.3 mm survey of a part of the ASAGAO field by Dunlop
        et al. Ofthe 25 total millimeter galaxies, 14 have Chandra
        counterparts. The observed AGN fractions at z=1.5{–}3 are
        found to be {90}_-19^+8% and {57}_-25^+23%
        for the ultra-luminous and luminous infrared galaxies with log
        {L}_{IR}/{L}_☉  = 12-12.8 and log
        {L}_{IR}/{L}_☉  = 11.5-12, respectively. The
        majority (̃2/3) of the ALMA and/or Herschel detected X-ray AGNs
        at z = 1.5-3 appear to be star-formation-dominant populations,
        having {L}_/ {L}_{IR} ratios smaller than
        the “simultaneous
        evolution” value expected from the local
        black-hole-mass-to-stellar-mass ({M}_{BH}-M _*)
        relation. On the basis of the {L}_ and stellar
        mass relation, we infer that a large fraction of star-forming
        galaxies at z=1.5{–}3 have black hole masses that are smaller
        than those expected from the local {M}_{BH}-M _*
        relation. This contrasts previous reports on luminous AGNs at
        the same redshifts detected in wider and shallower surveys,
        which are subject to selection biases against lower luminosity
        AGNs. Our results are consistent with an evolutionary scenario
        in which star formation occurs first, and an AGN-dominant phase
        follows later, in objects that finally evolve into galaxies with
        classical bulges.</p>

    <p>We present ALMA Band 9 observations of the [C II]158 \ensuremathμm
        emission for a sample of 10 main-sequence galaxies at redshift z
        ̃ 2, with typical stellar masses (log
        M_\ensuremath⋆/M_☉ ̃ 10.0-10.9) and star
        formation rates (̃35-115 M_☉ yr^-1). Given the strong
        and well-understood evolution of the interstellar medium from
        the present to z = 2, we investigate the behaviour of the [C II]
        emission and empirically identify its primary driver. We detect
        [C II] from six galaxies (four secure and two tentative) and
        estimate ensemble averages including non-detections. The [C II
        ]-to-infrared luminosity ratio ([C II]/L_IR) of our sample
        is similar to that of local main-sequence galaxies (̃2
        \texttimes 10^-3), and ̃10 times higher than that of
        starbursts. The [C II] emission has an average spatial extent of
        4-7 kpc, consistent with the optical size. Complementing our
        sample with literature data, we find that the [C II] luminosity
        correlates with galaxies’ molecular gas mass, with a mean
        absolute deviation of 0.2 dex and without evident systematics:
        the [C II]-to-H_2 conversion factor (\ensuremathα
        _[C II] ̃ 30 M_☉/L_☉) is largely independent of
        galaxies’ depletion time, metallicity, and redshift. [C II]
        seems therefore a convenient tracer to estimate galaxies’
        molecular gas content regardless of their starburst or main-
        sequence nature, and extending to metal-poor galaxies at low and
        high redshifts. The dearth of [C II] emission reported for z
        &gt; 6-7 galaxies might suggest either a high star formation
        efficiency or a small fraction of ultraviolet light from star
        formation reprocessed by dust.</p>

    <p><br /> Aims: We present a 69 arcmin^2 ALMA survey at 1.1 mm, GOODS-
        ALMA, matching the deepest HST-WFC3 H-band part of the GOODS-
        South field. <br /> Methods: We tapered the 0″24 original image
        with a homogeneous and circular synthesized beam of 0″60 to
        reduce the number of independent beams - thus reducing the
        number of purely statistical spurious detections - and optimize
        the sensitivity to point sources. We extracted a catalog of
        galaxies purely selected by ALMA and identified sources with and
        without HST counterparts down to a 5\ensuremathσ
        limiting depth of H = 28.2 AB (HST/WFC3 F160W). <br /> Results:
        ALMA detects 20 sources brighter than 0.7 mJy at 1.1 mm in the
        0″60 tapered mosaic (rms sensitivity \ensuremathσ ≃
        0.18 mJy beam^-1) with a purity greater than 80%. Among
        these detections, we identify three sources with no HST nor
        Spitzer-IRAC counterpart, consistent with the expected number of
        spurious galaxies from the analysis of the inverted image; their
        definitive status will require additional investigation. We
        detect additional three sources with HST counterparts either at
        high significance in the higher resolution map, or with
        different detection-algorithm parameters ensuring a purity
        greater than 80%. Hence we identify in total 20 robust
        detections. <br /> Conclusions: Our wide contiguous survey
        allows us to push further in redshift the blind detection of
        massive galaxies with ALMA with a median redshift of z = 2.92
        and a median stellar mass of M_\ensuremath⋆ = 1.1
        \texttimes 10^11 M_☉. Our sample includes 20% HST-
        dark galaxies (4 out of 20), all detected in the mid-infrared
        with Spitzer-IRAC. The near-infrared based photometric redshifts
        of two of them (z ̃ 4.3 and 4.8) suggest that these sources have
        redshifts z &gt; 4. At least 40% of the ALMA sources host an
        X-ray AGN, compared to ̃14% for other galaxies of similar mass
        and redshift. The wide area of our ALMA survey provides lower
        values at the bright end of number counts than single-dish
        telescopes affected by confusion.</p>

    <p><br /> Aims: We present a multiwavelength study of an atypical
        submillimeter galaxy, GH500.30, in the GOODS-North field, with
        the aim to understand its physical properties of stellar and
        dust emission, as well as the central active galactic nucleus
        (AGN) activity. Although it is shown that the source is likely
        an extremely dusty galaxy at high redshift, its exact position
        of submillimeter emission is unknown. <br /> Methods: We use
        NOEMA observation at 1.2 mm with subarcsecond resolution to
        resolve the dust emission, and precisely localize the
        counterparts at other wavelengths, which allows us to better
        constrain its stellar and dust spectral energy distribution
        (SED) as well as redshift. We carry out the new near-infrared
        (NIR) photometry of GH500.30 observed with HST, and perform
        panchromatic SED modelling from ultraviolet (UV)/optical to
        submillimeter. We derive the photometric redshift using both NIR
        and far-infrared (FIR) SED modeling, and place constraints on
        the stellar and dust properties such as stellar mass, age, dust
        attenuation, IR luminosity, and star-formation rate (SFR). The
        AGN properties are inferred from the X-ray spectral analysis and
        radio observations, and its contribution to the total IR
        luminosity is estimated from the broadband SED fittings using
        MAGPHYS. <br /> Results: With the new NOEMA interferometric
        imaging, we confirm that the source is a unique dusty galaxy. It
        has no obvious counterpart in the optical and even NIR images
        observed with HST at \ensuremathλ
        \ensuremath≲ 1.4 \ensuremathμm. Photometric-
        redshift analyses from both stellar and dust SED suggest it to
        likely be at z \ensuremath≳ 4, though a lower redshift
        at z \ensuremath≳ 3.1 cannot be fully ruled out (at
        90% confidence interval). Explaining its unusual optical-to-NIR
        properties requires an old stellar population (̃0.67 Gyr),
        coexisting with a very dusty ongoing starburst component. The
        latter is contributing to the FIR emission, with its rest-frame
        UV and optical light being largely obscured along our line of
        sight. If the observed fluxes at the rest-frame optical/NIR
        wavelengths were mainly contributed by old stars, a total
        stellar mass of ̃3.5 \texttimes 10^11 M_☉ would be
        obtained. An X-ray spectral analysis suggests that this galaxy
        harbors a heavily obscured AGN with N_H =
        3.3^+2.0_-1.7 \texttimes 10^23 cm^-2 and an
        intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of L_x ̃ 2.6 \texttimes
        10^44 erg s^-1, which places this object among distant
        type 2 quasars. The radio emission of the source is extremely
        bright, which is an order of magnitude higher than the star-
        formation-powered emission, making it one of the most distant
        radio-luminous dusty galaxies. <br /> Conclusions: The combined
        characteristics of the galaxy suggest that the source appears to
        have been caught in a rare but critical transition stage in the
        evolution of submillimeter galaxies, where we are witnessing the
        birth of a young AGN and possibly the earliest stage of its jet
        formation and feedback.</p>

    <p>We present a census of the molecular gas properties of galaxies in the
        most distant known X-ray cluster, CLJ1001, at z = 2.51, using
        deep observations of CO(1-0) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
        Array. In total, 14 cluster members with M _* &gt;
        10^10.5 M _☉ are detected, including all of the massive
        star-forming members within the virial radius, providing the
        largest galaxy sample in a single cluster at z &gt; 2 with
        CO(1-0) measurements. We find a large variety in the gas content
        of these cluster galaxies, which is correlated with their
        relative positions (or accretion states), with those closer to
        the cluster core being increasingly gas-poor. Moreover, despite
        their low gas content, the galaxies in the cluster center
        exhibit an elevated star formation efficiency (SFE; SFE = SFR/M
        _gas) compared to field galaxies, suggesting that the
        suppression on the SFR is likely delayed compared to that on the
        gas content. Their gas depletion time is around t _dep ̃ 400
        Myr, which is comparable to the cluster dynamical time. This
        implies that they will consume all of their gas within a single
        orbit around the cluster center, and form a passive cluster core
        by z ̃ 2. This result is one of the first direct pieces of
        evidence for the influence of environment on the gas reservoirs
        and SFE of z &gt; 2 cluster galaxies, thereby providing new
        insights into the rapid formation and quenching of the most
        massive galaxies in the early universe.</p>

    <p><br /> Aims: We use high-resolution continuum images obtained with the
        Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) to probe the surface
        density of star formation in z 2 galaxies and study the
        different physical properties between galaxies within and above
        the star-formation main sequence of galaxies. <br /> Methods: We
        use ALMA images at 870 \ensuremathμm with 0.2 arcsec
        resolution in order to resolve star formation in a sample of
        eight star-forming galaxies at z 2 selected among the most
        massive Herschel galaxies in the GOODS-South field. This sample
        is supplemented with eleven galaxies from the public data of the
        1.3 mm survey of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, HUDF. We derive
        dust and gas masses for the galaxies, compute their depletion
        times and gas fractions, and study the relative distributions of
        rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and far-infrared (FIR) light. <br />
        Results: ALMA reveals systematically dense concentrations of
        dusty star formation close to the center of the stellar
        component of the galaxies. We identify two different starburst
        regimes: (i) the classical population of starbursts located
        above the SFR-M_\ensuremath⋆ main sequence, with
        enhanced gas fractions and short depletion times and (ii) a sub-
        population of galaxies located within the scatter of the main
        sequence that experience compact star formation with depletion
        timescales typical of starbursts of 150 Myr. In both starburst
        populations, the FIR and UV are distributed in distinct regions
        and dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) estimated using
        UV-optical-near-infrared data alone underestimate the total SFR.
        Starbursts hidden in the main sequence show instead the lowest
        gas fractions of our sample and could represent the last stage
        of star formation prior to passivization. Being Herschel-
        selected, these main sequence galaxies are located in the high-
        mass end of the main sequence, hence we do not know whether
        these “starbursts hidden in the main sequence” also exist
        below 10^11 M_☉. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are
        found to be ubiquitous in these compact starbursts, suggesting
        that the triggering mechanism also feeds the central black hole
        or that the active nucleus triggers star formation.</p>

    <p>We present morphological properties of dusty star-forming galaxies at z
        = 1-3 determined with the high-resolution (FWHM ̃ 0.″19) Atacama
        Large Milllimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1 mm map of our
        ASAGAO survey covering a 26 arcmin^2 area in GOODS-S. In
        conjunction with the ALMA archival data, our sample consists of
        45 ALMA sources with infrared luminosity (L _IR) range of
        ̃10^11-10^13 L _☉. To obtain an average rest-
        frame far-infrared (FIR) profile, we perform individual
        measurements and careful stacking of the ALMA sources using the
        uv-visibility method that includes positional-uncertainty and
        smoothing-effect evaluations through Monte Carlo simulations. We
        find that our sample has an average FIR-wavelength Sérsic
        index and effective radius of n _FIR = 1.2
        \ensuremath\pm 0.2 and R _e,FIR = 1.0-1.3 kpc,
        respectively, additionally with a point-source component at the
        center, indicative of the existence of active galactic nuclei.
        The average FIR profile agrees with a morphology of an
        exponential disk clearly distinguished from a de Vaucouleurs
        spheroidal profile (Sérsic index of 4). We also examine the
        rest-frame optical Sérsic index n _opt and effective
        radius R _e,opt with deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
        images. Interestingly, we obtain n _opt = 0.9
        \ensuremath\pm 0.3 (≃n _FIR) and R _e,opt = 3.2
        \ensuremath\pm 0.6 kpc (&gt;R _e,FIR), suggesting that
        the dusty disk-like structure is embedded within a larger
        stellar disk. The rest-frame UV and FIR data of HST and ALMA
        provide us with a radial profile of the total star formation
        rate (SFR), where the infrared SFR dominates over the UV SFR at
        the center. Under the assumption of a constant SFR, a compact
        stellar distribution in z ̃ 1-2 compact quiescent galaxies
        (cQGs) is well reproduced, while a spheroidal stellar morphology
        of cQGs (n _opt = 4) is not, suggestive of other important
        mechanism(s) such as dynamical dissipation.</p>

    <p>Variations of star formation activity may happen on a large range of
        timescales and some of them are expected to be short, that is, a
        few hundred million years. The study of the physical processes
        linked to these rapid variations requires large statistical
        samples to pinpoint galaxies undergoing such transformations.
        Building upon a previous study, we define a method to blindly
        identify galaxies that have undergone, and may still be
        undergoing, a fast downfall of their star formation activity,
        that is, a more than 80% drop in star formation rate (SFR)
        occurring in less than 500 Myr. Modeling galaxies’ spectral
        energy distribution (SED) with a delayed-\ensuremathτ
        star formation history, with and without allowing an
        instantaneous SFR drop within the last hundred million years, we
        isolate 102 candidates out of a subsample of 6680 galaxies
        classified as “star forming” from the UVJ criterion in the
        ZFOURGE catalogs. These galaxies are mostly located in the lower
        part of the SFR-M_* main sequence (MS) and extend up to a
        factor 100 below it. They also lie close to the limit between
        the passive and active regions on the UVJ diagram, indicating
        that they are in a transition phase. We show that the selected
        candidates have different physical properties compared to
        galaxies with similar UVJ colors, namely, lower SFRs and
        different stellar masses. The morphology of the candidates shows
        no preference for a particular type. Among the 102 candidates,
        only 4 show signs of a active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity
        (from X-ray luminosity or ultraviolet-infrared (UV-IR) SED
        fitting decomposition). This low fraction of AGNs among the
        candidates implies that AGN activity may not be the main driver
        of the recent downfall, although timescale differences and duty
        cycle must be taken into account. We finally attempt to recover
        the past position of these galaxies on the SFR-M_* plane,
        before the downfall of their star formation and show that some
        of them were in the starburst region before, and are now back on
        the MS. These candidates constitute a promising sample that
        needs more investigation in order to understand the different
        mechanisms at the origin of the star formation decrease of the
        Universe since z 2.</p>

    <p>To explore the evolutionary connection among red, green, and blue galaxy
        populations, based on a sample of massive ({M}_* &gt;
        {10}^10 {M}_☉ ) galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 in
        five 3D-HST/CANDELS fields, we investigate the dust content,
        morphologies, structures, active galactic nucleus (AGN)
        fractions, and environments of these three populations. Green
        valley galaxies are found to have intermediate dust attenuation
        and reside in the middle of the regions occupied by quiescent
        and star-forming galaxies in the UVJ diagram. Compared with blue
        and red galaxy populations at z &lt; 2, green galaxies have
        intermediate compactness and morphological parameters. The above
        findings seem to favor the scenario that green galaxies are at a
        transitional phase when star-forming galaxies are being quenched
        into quiescent status. The green galaxies at z &lt; 2 show the
        highest AGN fraction, suggesting that AGN feedback may have
        played an important role in star formation quenching. For the
        massive galaxies at 2 &lt; z &lt; 2.5, both red and green
        galaxies are found to have a similarly higher AGN fraction than
        the blue ones, which implies that AGN feedback may help to keep
        quiescence of red galaxies at z &gt; 2. A significant
        environmental difference is found between green and red galaxies
        at z &lt; 1.5. Green and blue galaxies at z &gt; 0.5 seem to
        have similar local density distributions, suggesting that
        environment quenching is not the major mechanism to cease star
        formation at z &gt; 0.5. The fractions of three populations as
        functions of mass support a
        “downsizing” quenching
        picture that the bulk of star formation in more massive galaxies
        is completed earlier than that of lower-mass galaxies.</p>

    <p>We obtained ALMA spectroscopy and deep imaging to investigate the origin
        of the unexpected sub-millimeter emission toward the most
        distant quiescent galaxy known to date, ZF-COSMOS-20115 at z =
        3.717. We show here that this sub-millimeter emission is
        produced by another massive (M_* 10^11 M_☉),
        compact (r_1/2 = 0.67 \ensuremath\pm 0.14 kpc) and
        extremely obscured galaxy (A_V 3.5), located only 0.43“
        (3.1 kpc) away from the quiescent galaxy. We dub the quiescent
        and dusty galaxies Jekyll and Hyde, respectively. No dust
        emission is detected at the location of the quiescent galaxy,
        implying SFR &lt; 13 M_☉ yr^-1 which is the most
        stringent upper limit ever obtained for a quiescent galaxy at
        these redshifts. The two sources are spectroscopically confirmed
        to lie at the same redshift thanks to the detection of [C
        II]_158 in Hyde (z = 3.709), which provides one the few
        robust redshifts for a highly-obscured ”H-dropout“ galaxy (H -
        [4.5] = 5.1 \ensuremath\pm 0.8). The [C II] line shows a
        clear rotating-disk velocity profile which is blueshifted
        compared to the Balmer lines of Jekyll by 549 \ensuremath\pm
        60 km s^-1, demonstrating that it is produced by another
        galaxy. Careful de-blending of the Spitzer imaging confirms the
        existence of this new massive galaxy, and its non-detection in
        the Hubble images requires extremely red colors and strong
        attenuation by dust. Full modeling of the UV-to-far-IR emission
        of both galaxies shows that Jekyll has fully quenched at least
        200Myr prior to observation and still presents a challenge for
        models, while Hyde only harbors moderate star-formation with SFR
        \ensuremath≲ 120 M_☉ yr^-1, and is located at
        least a factor 1.4 below the z 4 main sequence. Hyde could also
        have stopped forming stars less than 200 Myr before being
        observed; this interpretation is also suggested by its
        compactness comparable to that of z 4 quiescent galaxies and its
        low [C II]/FIR ratio, but significant on-going star-formation
        cannot be ruled out. Lastly, we find that despite its moderate
        SFR, Hyde hosts a dense reservoir of gas comparable to that of
        the most extreme starbursts. This suggests that whatever
        mechanism has stopped or reduced its star-formation must have
        done so without expelling the gas outside of the galaxy. Because
        of their surprisingly similar mass, compactness, environment and
        star-formation history, we argue that Jekyll and Hyde can be
        seen as two stages of the same quenching process, and provide a
        unique laboratory to study this poorly understood phenomenon.

    <p>We present a sub-kiloparsec localization of the sites of supermassive
        black hole (SMBH) growth in three active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
        at z ̃ 3 in relation to the regions of intense star formation in
        their hosts. These AGNs are selected from Karl G. Jansky Very
        Large Array (VLA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
        Array (ALMA) observations in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field and
        COSMOS, with the centimetric radio emission tracing both star
        formation and AGN, and the sub/millimeter emission by dust
        tracing nearly pure star formation. We require radio emission to
        be \ensuremath≥slant 5\texttimes more luminous than the
        level associated with the sub/millimeter star formation to
        ensure that the radio emission is AGN-dominated, thereby
        allowing localization of the AGN and star formation
        independently. In all three galaxies, the AGNs are located
        within the compact regions of gas-rich, heavily obscured,
        intense nuclear star formation, with R _ e  = 0.4-1.1 kpc
        and average star formation rates of ≃100-1200 M _☉
        yr^-1. If the current episode of star formation continues at
        such a rate over the stellar mass doubling time of their hosts,
        ≃0.2 Gyr, the newly formed stellar mass will be of the order of
        10^11 M _☉ within the central kiloparsec region,
        concurrently and cospatially with significant growth of the
        SMBH. This is consistent with a picture of in situ galactic
        bulge and SMBH formation. This work demonstrates the unique
        complementarity of VLA and ALMA observations to unambiguously
        pinpoint the locations of AGNs and star formation down to ≃30
        mas, corresponding to ≃230 pc at z = 3.</p>

    <p>We present a new technique to measure multi-wavelength
        “super-deblended”
        photometry from highly confused images, which we apply to
        Herschel and ground-based far-infrared (FIR) and
        (sub-)millimeter (mm) data in the northern field of the Great
        Observatories Origins Deep Survey. There are two key novelties.
        First, starting with a large database of deep Spitzer 24
        \ensuremathμm and VLA 20 cm detections that are used to
        define prior positions for fitting the FIR/submm data, we
        perform an active selection of useful priors independently at
        each frequency band, moving from less to more confused bands.
        Exploiting knowledge of redshift and all available photometry,
        we identify hopelessly faint priors that we remove from the
        fitting pool. This approach significantly reduces blending
        degeneracies and allows reliable photometry to be obtained for
        galaxies in FIR+mm bands. Second, we obtain well-behaved, nearly
        Gaussian flux density uncertainties, individually tailored to
        all fitted priors for each band. This is done by exploiting
        extensive simulations that allow us to calibrate the conversion
        of formal fitting uncertainties to realistic uncertainties,
        depending on directly measurable quantities. We achieve deeper
        detection limits with high fidelity measurements and
        uncertainties at FIR+mm bands. As an illustration of the utility
        of these measurements, we identify 70 galaxies with
        z\ensuremath≥slant 3 and reliable FIR+mm detections. We
        present new constraints on the cosmic star formation rate
        density at 3&lt; z&lt; 6, finding a significant contribution
        from z\ensuremath≥slant 3 dusty galaxies that are missed
        by optical-to-near-infrared color selection. Photometric
        measurements for 3306 priors, including more than 1000 FIR+mm
        detections, are released publicly with our catalog.</p>

    <p>We present a new, publicly available library of dust spectral energy
        distributions (SEDs). These SEDs are characterized by only three
        parameters: the dust mass (M_dust), the dust temperature
        (T_dust), and the mid-to-total infrared color (IR8
        \ensuremath≡ L_IR/L_8). The latter measures the
        relative contribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
        molecules to the total infrared luminosity. We used this library
        to model star-forming galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 4 in the
        deep CANDELS fields, using both individual detections and stacks
        of Herschel and ALMA imaging, and extending this sample to z = 0
        using the Herschel Reference Survey. At first order, the dust
        SED of a galaxy was observed to be independent of stellar mass,
        but evolving with redshift. We found trends of increasing
        T_dust and IR8 with redshift and distance from the
        SFR-M_\ensuremath* main sequence, and quantified for the
        first time their intrinsic scatter. Half of the observed
        variations of these parameters was captured by the above
        empirical relations, and after subtracting the measurement
        errors we found residual scatters of
        \ensuremath∆T_dust/T_dust = 12% and
        \ensuremath∆log IR8 = 0.18 dex. We observed second
        order variations with stellar mass: massive galaxies
        (M_\ensuremath* &gt; 10^11M_☉) at z
        \ensuremath≤ 1 have slightly lower temperatures
        indicative of a reduced star formation efficiency, while low
        mass galaxies (M_\ensuremath* &lt; 10^10M_☉)
        at z \ensuremath≥ 1 showed reduced PAH emission, possibly
        linked to their lower metallicities. Building on these results,
        we constructed high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogs to predict the
        accuracy of infrared luminosities and dust masses determined
        using a single broadband measurement. Using a single James Webb
        Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI band, we found that L_IR is
        typically uncertain by 0.15 dex, with a maximum of 0.25 dex when
        probing the rest-frame 8 \ensuremathμm, and this is not
        significantly impacted by typical redshift uncertainties. On the
        other hand, we found that ALMA bands 8 to 7 and 6 to 3 measured
        the dust mass at better than 0.2 and 0.15 dex, respectively, and
        independently of redshift, while bands 9 to 6 only measured
        L_IR at better than 0.2 dex at z &gt; 1, 3.2, 3.8, and 5.7,
        respectively. Starburst galaxies had their L_IR
        significantly underestimated when measured by a single JWST or
        ALMA band, while their dust mass from a single ALMA band were
        moderately overestimated. This dust library and the results of
        this paper can be used immediately to improve the design of
        observing proposals, and interpret more accurately the large
        amount of archival data from Spitzer, Herschel and ALMA. The
        dust library described in this paper is available publicly at &lt;A

    <p>We search for passive galaxies at z &gt; 3 in the GOODS-South field,
        using different techniques based on photometric data, and paying
        attention to develop methods that are sensitive to objects that
        have become passive shortly before the epoch of observation. We
        use CANDELS HST catalogues, ultra-deep Ks data and new IRAC
        photometry, performing spectral energy distribution fitting
        using models with abruptly quenched star formation histories. We
        then single out galaxies which are best fitted by a passively
        evolving model, and having only low probability (&lt;5 per
        cent) star-forming solutions. We verify the effects of including
        nebular lines emission, and we consider possible solutions at
        different redshifts. The number of selected sources dramatically
        depends on the models used in the spectral energy distribution
        (SED) fitting. Without including emission lines and with
        photometric redshifts fixed at the CANDELS estimate, we single
        out 30 candidates; the inclusion of nebular lines emission
        reduces the sample to 10 objects; allowing for solutions at
        different redshifts, only two galaxies survive as robust
        candidates. Most of the candidates are not far-infrared
        emitters, corroborating their association with passive galaxies.
        Our results translate into an upper limit in the number density
        of ̃0.173 arcmin^2 above the detection limit. However, we
        conclude that the selection of passive galaxies at z &gt; 3 is
        still subject to significant uncertainties, being sensitive to
        assumptions in the SED modelling adopted and to the relatively
        low S/N of the objects. By means of dedicated simulations, we
        show that JWST will greatly enhance the accuracy, allowing for a
        much more robust classification.</p>

    <p>We present the survey design, data reduction, construction of images,
        and source catalog of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
        Array (ALMA) twenty-six arcmin^2 survey of GOODS-S at one
        millimeter (ASAGAO). ASAGAO is a deep (1 \ensuremathσ
        depth ̃ 61 \ensuremathμJy beam^-1 for a 250
        k\ensuremathλ-tapered map with a synthesized beam size
        of 0{\^“_.}51 \texttimes 0{\^”_.}45) and wide
        area (26 arcmin^2) survey on a contiguous field at 1.2 mm.
        By combining with ALMA archival data in the GOODS-South field,
        we obtained a deeper map in the same region (1
        \ensuremathσ depth ̃ 30 \ensuremathμJy
        beam^-1 for a deep region with a 250
        k\ensuremathλ-taper, and a synthesized beam size of
        0{\^“_.}59 \texttimes 0{\^”_.}53), providing the
        largest sample of sources (25 sources at \ensuremath≥5.0
        \ensuremathσ, 45 sources at \ensuremath≥4.5
        \ensuremathσ) among ALMA blank-field surveys to date.
        The number counts show that 52\^{+11}_{-8}% of the
        extragalactic background light at 1.2 mm is resolved into
        discrete sources at S_1.2 mm &gt; 135 \ensuremathμJy.
        We create infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) in the
        redshift range of z = 1-3 from the ASAGAO sources with
        K_s-band counterparts, and constrain the faintest luminosity
        of the LF at 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 3.0. The LFs are consistent with
        previous results based on other ALMA and SCUBA-2 observations,
        which suggest a positive luminosity evolution and negative
        density evolution with increasing redshift. We find that
        obscured star-formation of sources with IR luminosities of log
        (L_IR/L_☉) \ensuremath≳ 11.8 account for
        \ensuremath≈60%-90% of the z ̃ 2 cosmic star-
        formation rate density.</p>

    <p>We show that the most distant X-ray-detected cluster known to date, Cl
        J1001 at {z}_{spec}=2.506, hosts a strong overdensity of

        an active galactic nucleus (AGN) likely affects the radio

        radio foregrounds leaves Cl J1001 as the second strongest
        overdensity, while even using all radio sources Cl J1001 remains
        among the four strongest projected overdensities. We conclude
        that there are great prospects for future deep and wide-area
        radio surveys to discover large samples of the first generation
        of forming galaxy clusters. In these remarkable structures,
        widespread star formation and AGN activity of massive galaxy
        cluster members, residing within the inner cluster core, will
        ultimately lead to radio continuum as one of the most effective
        means for their identification, with detection rates expected in
        the ballpark of 0.1-1 per square degree at
        z\ensuremath≳ 2.5. Samples of hundreds such high-
        redshift clusters could potentially constrain cosmological
        parameters and test cluster and galaxy formation models.</p>

    <p>This paper introduces EGG, the Empirical Galaxy Generator, a tool
        designed within the ASTRODEEP collaboration to generate mock
        galaxy catalogs for deep fields with realistic fluxes and simple
        morphologies. The simulation procedure is based exclusively on
        empirical prescriptions - rather than first principles - to
        provide the most accurate match with current observations at 0
        &lt;z&lt; 7. We considered that galaxies can be either
        quiescent or star-forming, and used their stellar mass
        (M_\ensuremath*) and redshift (z) as the fundamental
        properties from which all the other observables can be
        statistically derived. Drawing z and M_\ensuremath* from
        the observed galaxy stellar mass functions, a star-formation
        rate (SFR) is attributed to each galaxy from the tight
        SFR-M_\ensuremath* main sequence, while dust
        attenuation, optical colors and simple disk plus bulge
        morphologies are obtained from empirical relations that we
        established from the high quality Hubble and Herschel
        observations from the CANDELS fields. Random scatter was
        introduced in each step to reproduce the observed distributions
        of each parameter. Based on these observables, an adequate
        panchromatic spectral energy distribution (SED) is selected for
        each galaxy and synthetic photometry is produced by integrating
        the redshifted SED in common broad-band filters. Finally, the
        mock galaxies are placed on the sky at random positions with a
        fixed angular two-point correlation function to implement basic
        clustering. The resulting flux catalogs reproduce accurately the
        observed number counts in all broad bands from the ultraviolet
        up to the sub-millimeter, and can be directly fed to image
        simulators such as SkyMaker. The images can then be used to test
        source extraction softwares and image-based techniques such as
        stacking. EGG is open-source, and is made available to the
        community on behalf of the ASTRODEEP collaboration, together
        with a set of pre-generated catalogs and images. &lt;A href=“http:

    <p>We explore the dependence of the incidence of moderate-luminosity
        (L_0.5-8 keV = 10^41.9-43.7 erg s^-1) active
        galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the distribution of their accretion
        rates on host color at 0.5 &lt;z &lt; 2.5. Based on the
        deepest X-ray and UV-to-far-infrared data in the two The Great
        Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) fields, we identify
        221 AGNs within a mass-complete parent galaxy sample down to
        M_\ensuremath* &gt; 10^10 M_☉. We use
        extinction-corrected rest-frame U-V colors to divide both AGN
        hosts and non-AGN galaxies into red sequence (red), green valley
        (green), and blue cloud (blue) populations. We find that the
        fraction of galaxies hosting an AGN at fixed X-ray luminosity
        increases with stellar mass and redshift for all the three
        galaxy populations, independent of their colors. However, both
        the AGN fraction at fixed stellar mass and its evolution with
        redshift are clearly dependent on host colors. Most notably, red
        galaxies have the lowest AGN fraction ( 5%) at z 1 yet with
        most rapid evolution with redshift, increasing by a factor of 5
        (24%) at z 2. Green galaxies exhibit the highest AGN fraction
        across all redshifts, which is most pronounced at z 2 with more
        than half of them hosting an AGN at M_\ensuremath* &gt;
        10^10.6 M_☉. Together with the high AGN fraction in red
        galaxies at z 2, this indicates that (X-ray) AGNs could be
        important in both transforming (quenching) star-forming galaxies
        into quiescent ones and subsequently maintaining their
        quiescence at high redshift. Furthermore, consistent with
        previous studies at lower redshifts, we show that the
        probability of hosting an AGN for the total galaxy population
        can be characterized by a universal Eddington ratio (as
        approximated by L_X/M_\ensuremath*) distribution
        (p(\ensuremathλ_Edd)
        \ensuremathλ_Edd^-0.4), which is independent
        on host mass. Yet consistent with their different AGN fractions,
        galaxies with different colors appear to also have different
        p(\ensuremathλ_Edd) with red galaxies exhibiting
        more rapid redshift evolution compared with that for green and
        blue galaxies. Evidence for a steeper power-law distribution of
        p(\ensuremathλ_Edd) in red galaxies
        (p(\ensuremathλ_Edd)
        \ensuremathλ_Edd^-0.6) is also presented,
        though larger samples are needed to confirm. These results
        suggest that the AGN accretion or the growth of supermassive
        black holes is related to their host properties, and may also
        influence their hosts in a different mode dependent on the host
        color.</p>

    <p>We introduce the ALMA Redshift 4 Survey (AR4S), a systematic ALMA survey
        of all the known galaxies with stellar mass
        (M_\ensuremath*) larger than 5 \texttimes
        10^10M_☉ at 3.5 &lt;z&lt; 4.7 in the GOODS-south,
        UDS and COSMOS CANDELS fields. The sample we have analyzed in
        this paper is composed of 96 galaxies observed with ALMA at 890
        \ensuremathμm (180 \ensuremathμm rest-frame) with an
        on-source integration time of 1.3 min per galaxy. We detected
        32% of the sample at more than 3\ensuremathσ
        significance. Using the stacked ALMA and Herschel photometry, we
        derived an average dust temperature of 40 \ensuremath\pm 2 K
        for the whole sample, and extrapolate the L_IR and SFR for
        all our galaxies based on their ALMA flux. We then used a
        forward modeling approach to estimate their intrinsic sSFR
        distribution, deconvolved of measurement errors and selection
        effects: we find a linear relation between SFR and
        M_\ensuremath*, with a median sSFR = 2.8
        \ensuremath\pm 0.8 Gyr and a dispersion around that relation
        of 0.28 \ensuremath\pm 0.13 dex. This latter value is
        consistent with that measured at lower redshifts, which is proof
        that the main sequence of star-forming galaxies was already in
        place at z = 4, at least among massive galaxies. These new
        constraints on the properties of the main sequence are in good
        agreement with the latest predictions from numerical
        simulations, and suggest that the bulk of star formation in
        galaxies is driven by the same mechanism from z = 4 to the
        present day, that is, over at least 90% of the cosmic history.
        We also discuss the consequences of our results on the
        population of early quiescent galaxies. This paper is part of a
        series that will employ these new ALMA observations to explore
        the star formation and dust properties of the massive end of the
        z = 4 galaxy population.</p>

    <p>We present a new method to search for candidate z \ensuremath≳
        2 Herschel 500 \ensuremathμm sources in the Great
        Observatories Origins Deep Survey-North field using a S_500
        \ensuremathμm/S_24 \ensuremathμm
        “color deconfusion”
        technique. Potential high-z sources are selected against low-
        redshift ones from their large 500 to 24 \ensuremathμm
        flux density ratios. By effectively reducing the contribution
        from low-redshift populations to the observed 500
        \ensuremathμm emission, we are able to identify
        counterparts to high-z 500 \ensuremathμm sources whose 24
        \ensuremathμm fluxes are relatively faint. The recovery of
        known z \ensuremath≳ 4 starbursts confirms the
        efficiency of this approach in selecting high-z Herschel
        sources. The resulting sample consists of 34 dusty star-forming
        galaxies at z \ensuremath≳ 2. The inferred infrared
        luminosities are in the range 1.5 \texttimes 10^12-1.8
        \texttimes 10^13 L_☉, corresponding to dust-obscured
        star formation rates (SFRs) of ̃260-3100 M_☉ yr^-1 for a
        Salpeter initial mass function. Comparison with previous SCUBA
        850 \ensuremathμ -selected galaxy samples shows
        that our method is more efficient at selecting high-z dusty
        galaxies, with a median redshift of z=3.07+/- 0.83 and with 10
        of the sources at z \ensuremath≳ 4. We find that at a
        fixed luminosity, the dust temperature is ̃5 K cooler than that
        expected from the {T}_d-{L}_ relation at
        z\textbackslashquad \ensuremath≲ 1, though different
        temperature selection effects should be taken into account. The
        radio-detected subsample (excluding three strong active galactic
        nucleus) follows the far-infrared (far-IR)/radio correlation at
        lower redshifts, and no evolution with redshift is observed out
        to z̃ 5, suggesting that the far-IR emission is star formation
        dominated. The contribution of the high-z Herschel 500
        \ensuremathμm sources to the cosmic SFR density is
        comparable to that of (sub)millimeter galaxy populations at z̃
        2.5 and at least 40% of the extinction-corrected UV samples at
        z̃ 4. Further investigation into the nature of these high-z
        dusty galaxies will be crucial for our understanding of the star
        formation histories and the buildup of stellar mass at the
        earliest cosmic epochs.</p>

    <p>We report the discovery of a remarkable concentration of massive
        galaxies with extended X-ray emission at z _spec = 2.506,
        which contains 11 massive (M _* \ensuremath≳
        10^11 M _☉) galaxies in the central 80 kpc region
        (11.6\ensuremathσ overdensity). We have
        spectroscopically confirmed 17 member galaxies with 11 from CO
        and the remaining ones from H\ensuremathα. The X-ray
        luminosity, stellar mass content, and velocity dispersion all
        point to a collapsed, cluster-sized dark matter halo with mass M
        _200c  = 10^13.9\ensuremath\pm0.2 M _☉, making
        it the most distant X-ray-detected cluster known to date. Unlike
        other clusters discovered so far, this structure is dominated by
        star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the core with only 2 out of the
        11 massive galaxies classified as quiescent. The star formation
        rate (SFR) in the 80 kpc core reaches ̃3400 M _☉ yr^-1
        with a gas depletion time of ̃200 Myr, suggesting that we caught
        this cluster in rapid build-up of a dense core. The high SFR is
        driven by both a high abundance of SFGs and a higher starburst
        fraction (̃25%, compared to 3%-5% in the field). The presence
        of both a collapsed, cluster-sized halo and a predominant
        population of massive SFGs suggests that this structure could
        represent an important transition phase between protoclusters
        and mature clusters. It provides evidence that the main phase of
        massive galaxy passivization will take place after galaxies
        accrete onto the cluster, providing new insights into massive
        cluster formation at early epochs. The large integrated stellar
        mass at such high redshift challenges our understanding of
        massive cluster formation.</p>

    <p>Improving the capabilities of detecting faint X-ray sources is
        fundamental for increasing the statistics on faint high-z active
        galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star-forming galaxies (SFGs). We
        performed a simultaneous maximum likelihood point-spread
        function fit in the [0.5-2] keV and [2-7] keV energy bands of
        the 4 Ms Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) data at the position of
        the 34,930 CANDELS H-band selected galaxies. For each detected
        source we provide X-ray photometry and optical counterpart
        validation. We validated this technique by means of a ray-
        tracing simulation. We detected a total of 698 X-ray point
        sources with a likelihood { L }\textbackslashgt 4.98 (I.e.,
        &gt;2.7\ensuremathσ). We show that prior knowledge of
        a deep sample of optical-NIR galaxies leads to a significant
        increase in the detection of faint (I.e., ̃10^-17 cgs in the
        [0.5-2] keV band) sources with respect to
        “blind” X-ray detections.
        By including previous X-ray catalogs, this work increases the
        total number of X-ray sources detected in the 4 Ms CDFS, CANDELS
        area to 793, which represents the largest sample of extremely
        faint X-ray sources assembled to date. Our results suggest that
        a large fraction of the optical counterparts of our X-ray
        sources determined by likelihood ratio actually coincides with
        the priors used for the source detection. Most of the new
        detected sources are likely SFGs or faint, absorbed AGNs. We
        identified a few sources with putative photometric redshift z
        &gt; 4. Despite the low number statistics and the uncertainties
        on the photo z, this sample significantly increases the number
        of X-ray-selected candidate high-z AGNs.</p>

    <p>We study the causes of the reported mass-dependence in the slope of the
        SFR-M_\ensuremath* relation, the so-called main sequence
        of star-forming galaxies, and discuss its implication on the
        physical processes that shaped the star formation history of
        massive galaxies over cosmic time. We made use of the near-
        infrared high-resolution imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope
        in the CANDELS fields to perform a careful bulge-to-disk
        decomposition of distant galaxies and measure for the first time
        the slope of the SFR-M_disk relation at z = 1. We find that
        this relation very closely follows the shape of the nominal
        SFR-M_\ensuremath* correlation, still with a pronounced
        flattening at the high-mass end. This clearly excludes, at least
        at z = 1, the progressive growth of quiescent stellar bulges in
        star-forming galaxies as the main driver for the change of slope
        of the main sequence. Then, by stacking the Herschel data
        available in the CANDELS field, we estimated the gas mass
        (M_gas = M_H I + M_H<sub>2</sub>) and the star
        formation efficiency (SFE \ensuremath≡ SFR/M_gas)
        at different positions on the SFR-M_\ensuremath*
        relation. We find that the relatively low SFRs observed in
        massive galaxies (M_\ensuremath*&gt; 5 \texttimes
        10^10 M_☉) are not caused by a reduced gas content,
        but by a star formation efficiency that is lower by up to a
        factor of 3 than in galaxies with lower stellar mass. The trend
        at the lowest masses is probably linked to the dominance of
        atomic over molecular gas. We argue that this stellar-mass-
        dependent SFE can explain the varying slope of the main sequence
        since z = 1.5, hence over 70% of the Hubble time. The drop in
        SFE occurs at lower masses in the local Universe
        (M_\ensuremath*&gt; 2 \texttimes 10^10 M_☉)
        and is not present at z = 2. Altogether, this provides evidence
        for a slow decrease in star formation efficiency in massive main
        sequence galaxies. The resulting loss of star formation is found
        to be rising starting from z = 2 to reach a level similar to the
        mass growth of the quiescent population by z = 1. We finally
        discuss the possible physical origin of this phenomenon.</p>

    <p>Context. The Frontier Fields survey is a pioneering observational
        program aimed at collecting photometric data, both from space
        (Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope) and from
        ground-based facilities (VLT Hawk-I), for six deep fields
        pointing at clusters of galaxies and six nearby deep parallel
        fields, in a wide range of passbands. The analysis of these data
        is a natural outcome of the Astrodeep project, an EU
        collaboration aimed at developing methods and tools for
        extragalactic photometry and creating valuable public
        photometric catalogues. <br /> Aims: We produce multiwavelength
        photometric catalogues (from B to 4.5 \ensuremathμm) for
        the first two of the Frontier Fields, Abell-2744 and MACS-J0416
        (plus their parallel fields). <br /> Methods: To detect faint
        sources even in the central regions of the clusters, we develop
        a robust and repeatable procedure that uses the public codes
        Galapagos and Galfit to model and remove most of the light
        contribution from both the brightest cluster members, and the
        intra-cluster light. We perform the detection on the processed
        HST H160 image to obtain a pure H-selected sample, which is the
        primary catalogue that we publish. We also add a sample of
        sources which are undetected in the H160 image but appear on a
        stacked infrared image. Photometry on the other HST bands is
        obtained using SExtractor, again on processed images after the
        procedure for foreground light removal. Photometry on the Hawk-I
        and IRAC bands is obtained using our PSF-matching deconfusion
        code t-phot. A similar procedure, but without the need for the
        foreground light removal, is adopted for the Parallel fields.
        <br /> Results: The procedure of foreground light subtraction
        allows for the detection and the photometric measurements of
        \raisebox-0.5ex\textasciitilde2500 sources per field. We
        deliver and release complete photometric H-detected catalogues,
        with the addition of the complementary sample of infrared-
        detected sources. All objects have multiwavelength coverage
        including B to H HST bands, plus K-band from Hawk-I, and 3.6-4.5
        \ensuremathμm from Spitzer. full and detailed treatment of
        photometric errors is included. We perform basic sanity checks
        on the reliability of our results. <br /> Conclusions: The
        multiwavelength photometric catalogues are available publicly
        and are ready to be used for scientific purposes. Our procedures
        allows for the detection of outshone objects near the bright
        galaxies, which, coupled with the magnification effect of the
        clusters, can reveal extremely faint high redshift sources. Full
        analysis on photometric redshifts is presented in Paper II. The
        catalogues, together with the final processed images for all HST
        bands (as well as some diagnostic data and images), are publicly
        available and can be downloaded from the Astrodeep website at &lt;A
        href=“http://www.astrodeep.eu/frontier-
        fields/”&gt;http://www.astrodeep.eu/frontier-fields/&lt;/A&gt; and from

        /ff/index.html”&gt;http://astrodeep.u-strasbg.fr/ff/index.html&lt;/A&gt;
        ). The catalogues are also available at the CDS via anonymous
        ftp to &lt;A href=“http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr”&gt;http://cdsarc.u-st

    <p><br /> Aims: We present the first public release of photometric
        redshifts, galaxy rest frame properties and associated
        magnification values in the cluster and parallel pointings of
        the first two Frontier Fields, Abell-2744 and MACS-J0416. The
        released catalogues aim to provide a reference for future
        investigations of extragalactic populations in these legacy
        fields: from lensed high-redshift galaxies to cluster members
        themselves. <br /> Methods: We exploit a multiwavelength
        catalogue, ranging from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to ground-
        based K and Spitzer IRAC, which is specifically designed to
        enable detection and measurement of accurate fluxes in crowded
        cluster regions. The multiband information is used to derive
        photometric redshifts and physical properties of sources
        detected either in the H-band image alone, or from a stack of
        four WFC3 bands. To minimize systematics, median photometric
        redshifts are assembled from six different approaches to photo-z
        estimates. Their reliability is assessed through a comparison
        with available spectroscopic samples. State-of-the-art lensing
        models are used to derive magnification values on an object-by-
        object basis by taking into account sources positions and
        redshifts. <br /> Results: We show that photometric redshifts
        reach a remarkable \raisebox-0.5ex\textasciitilde3-5%
        accuracy. After accounting for magnification, the H-band number
        counts are found to be in agreement at bright magnitudes with
        number counts from the CANDELS fields, while extending the
        presently available samples to galaxies that, intrinsically, are
        as faint as H \raisebox-0.5ex~32-33, thanks to
        strong gravitational lensing. The Frontier Fields allow the
        galaxy stellar mass distribution to be probed, depending on
        magnification, at 0.5-1.5 dex lower masses with respect to
        extragalactic wide fields, including sources at M_star
        \raisebox-0.5ex~10^7-10^8 M_☉
        at z &gt; 5. Similarly, they allow the detection of objects
        with intrinsic star formation rates (SFRs) &gt;1 dex lower than
        in the CANDELS fields reaching 0.1-1 M_☉/yr at z
        \raisebox-0.5ex~6-10. The catalogues, together
        with the final processed images for all HST bands (as well as
        some diagnostic data and images), are publicly available and can
        be downloaded from the Astrodeep website at &lt;A

  <span class="abstract hidden">
    <p>We introduce a new color selection technique to identify high-redshift,
        massive galaxies that are systematically missed by Lyman-break
        selection. The new selection is based on the H_160 (H) and
        Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) 4.5 \ensuremathμm bands,
        specifically H-[4.5]\textbackslashgt 2.25 mag. These galaxies,
        called “HIEROs,” include
        two major populations that can be separated with an additional J
        - H color. The populations are massive and dusty star-forming
        galaxies at z\textbackslashgt 3 ({JH}-{blue}) and extremely
        dusty galaxies at z\ensuremath≲ 3 ({JH}-{red}).
        The 350 arcmin^2 of the GOODS-North and GOODS-South fields
        with the deepest Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Camera
        3 (WFC3) near-infrared and IRAC data contain as many as 285
        HIEROs down to [4.5]\textbackslashlt 24 mag. Inclusion of the
        most extreme HIEROs, not even detected in the H band, makes this
        selection particularly complete for the identification of
        massive high-redshift galaxies. We focus here primarily on
        {JH}-{blue} (z\textbackslashgt 3) HIEROs, which have a
        median photometric redshift &lt; z&gt; ̃ 4.4 and stellar mass
        {M}_*̃ {10}^10.6 {M}_☉  and are much fainter
        in the rest-frame UV than similarly massive Lyman-break galaxies
        (LBGs). Their star formation rates (SFRs), derived from their
        stacked infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs), reach
        ̃240 {M}_☉  yr^-1, leading to a specific SFR,
        \textbackslashequiv /{M}_*̃ 4.2
        Gyr^-1, suggesting that the sSFRs for massive galaxies
        continue to grow at z\textbackslashgt 2 but at a lower growth
        rate than from z = 0 to z = 2. With a median half-light radius
        of 2 kpc, including ̃ 20% as compact as quiescent (QS) galaxies
        at similar redshifts, {JH}-{blue} HIEROs represent perfect
        star-forming progenitors of the most massive
        ({M}_*\ensuremath≳ {10}^11.2 {M}_☉ )
        compact QS galaxies at z̃ 3 and have the right number density.
        HIEROs make up ̃ 60% of all galaxies with
        {M}_*\textbackslashgt {10}^10.5 {M}_☉ 
        identified at z\textbackslashgt 3 from their photometric
        redshifts. This is five times more than LBGs with nearly no
        overlap between the two populations. While HIEROs make up
        15%-25% of the total SFR density at z̃ 4-5, they completely
        dominate the SFR density taking place in
        {M}_*\textbackslashgt {10}^10.5 {M}_☉ 
        galaxies, and HIEROs are therefore crucial to understanding the
        very early phase of massive galaxy formation.</p>

    <p><br /> Aims: We present the new release - version 2.0 - of t-phot, a
        publicly available software package developed to perform PSF-
        matched, prior-based, multiwavelength deconfusion photometry of
        extragalactic fields. <br /> Methods: New features included in
        the code are presented and discussed: background estimation,
        fitting using position dependent kernels, flux prioring,
        diagnostical statistics on the residual image, exclusion of
        selected sources from the model and residual images, and
        individual registration of fitted objects. <br /> Results: The
        new options improve on the performance of the code, allowing for
        more accurate results and providing useful aids for diagnostics.</p>

    <p>Context. The advent of deep multiwavelength extragalactic surveys has
        led to the necessity for advanced and fast methods for
        photometric analysis. In fact, codes which allow analyses of the
        same regions of the sky observed at different wavelengths and
        resolutions are becoming essential to thoroughly exploit current
        and future data. In this context, a key issue is the confusion
        (i.e. blending) of sources in low-resolution images. <br />
        Aims: We present t-phot, a publicly available software package
        developed within the astrodeep project. t-phot is aimed at
        extracting accurate photometry from low-resolution images, where
        the blending of sources can be a serious problem for the
        accurate and unbiased measurement of fluxes and colours. <br />
        Methods: t-phot can be considered as the next generation to
        tfit, providing significant improvements over and above it and
        other similar codes (e.g. convphot). t-phot gathers data from a
        high-resolution image of a region of the sky, and uses this
        information (source positions and morphologies) to obtain priors
        for the photometric analysis of the lower resolution image of
        the same field. t-phot can handle different types of datasets as
        input priors, namely i) a list of objects that will be used to
        obtain cutouts from the real high-resolution image; ii) a set of
        analytical models (as .fits stamps); iii) a list of unresolved,
        point-like sources, useful for example for far-infrared (FIR)
        wavelength domains. <br /> Results: By means of simulations and
        analysis of real datasets, we show that t-phot yields accurate
        estimations of fluxes within the intrinsic uncertainties of the
        method, when systematic errors are taken into account (which can
        be done thanks to a flagging code given in the output). t-phot
        is many times faster than similar codes like tfit and convphot
        (up to hundreds, depending on the problem and the method
        adopted), whilst at the same time being more robust and more
        versatile. This makes it an excellent choice for the analysis of
        large datasets. When used with the same parameter sets as for
        tfit it yields almost identical results (although in a much
        shorter time); in addition we show how the use of different
        settings and methods significantly enhances the performance. <br /> Conclusions: t-phot proves to be a state-of-the-art tool for
        multiwavelength optical to far-infrared image photometry. Given
        its versatility and robustness, t-phot can be considered the
        preferred choice for combined photometric analysis of current
        and forthcoming extragalactic imaging surveys. t-phot is
        publicly available for downloading from &lt;A href=“http://www.ast

        infrared photometry to estimate stellar masses and star
        formation rates (SFR) of centrals and satellites down to
        \raisebox-0.5ex~6 \texttimes
        10^9M_☉. We stack data around 215 central galaxies to
        statistically detect their satellite halos, finding an average
        of \raisebox-0.5ex\textasciitilde3 galaxies in excess of the
        background density. We fit the radial profiles of satellites
        with simple \ensuremathβ-models, and compare their
        integrated properties to model predictions. We find that the
        total stellar mass of satellites amounts to
        \raisebox-0.5ex\textasciitilde68% of the central galaxy,
        while spectral energy distribution modeling and far-infrared
        photometry consistently show their total SFR to be 25-35% of
        the central’s rate. We also see significant variation in the
        specific SFR of satellites within the halo with, in particular,
        a sharp decrease at &lt;100 kpc. After considering different
        potential explanations, we conclude that this is likely an
        environmental signature of the hot inner halo. This effect can
        be explained in the first order by a simple free-fall scenario,
        suggesting that these low-mass environments can shut down star
        formation in satellites on relatively short timescales of
        \raisebox-0.5ex\textasciitilde0.3 Gyr.</p>

    <p>The dispersion of the star formation main sequence (SFMS) reflects the
        diversity of star formation histories (SFHs) and variation in
        star formation rates (SFRs) in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) with
        similar stellar masses (M*). We examine the dispersion of the
        local SFMS using a complete sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey
        galaxies at 0.01\textbackslashlt z\textbackslashlt 0.03 with
        {log}(M*/{M}_☉ ) \textbackslashgt 8.8. The SFRs are
        estimated from H\ensuremathα in combination with 22
        \ensuremathμm observation from the Wide-field Infrared
        Survey Explorer. We measure the dispersion of specific SFRs
        (sSFRs) as a function of M*. We confirm that the dispersion
        increases with M* from 0.37 \ensuremath\pm 0.01 dex at
        {log}(M*/{M}_☉ )\textbackslashlt 9.6 to 0.51
        \ensuremath\pm 0.02 dex at {log}(M*/{M}_☉ )
        \textbackslashgt 10.2. Despite star formation being mostly
        associated with disks, the dispersion of disk sSFR still
        increases with M*. We conclude that the presence of bulges/bars
        is likely responsible for the large dispersion of sSFR in
        massive SFGs, while low-mass SFGs are mostly disk dominated and
        thus have a small dispersion. Our results suggest that star
        formation on galactic scales is dramatically affected by central
        dense structures through both enhancing and/or quenching
        processes, while lower-mass SFGs tend to have less bursty SFHs.
        However, the dispersion of the sSFR becomes significantly
        smaller and remains constant when only disk-dominated SFGs are
        counted. This finding implies that the impact of stochastic
        stellar feedback on star formation is likely to follow the same
        pattern in all disk galaxies, showing no correlation with halo
        potential.</p>

    <p>We use deep panchromatic data sets in the GOODS-N field, from GALEX to
        the deepest Herschel far-infrared (FIR) and VLA radio continuum
        imaging, to explore the evolution of star-formation activity and
        dust attenuation properties of star-forming galaxies to z ≃ 4,
        using mass-complete samples. Our main results can be summarized
        as follows: (i) the slope of the star-formation rate-M_*
        correlation is consistent with being constant ≃0.8 up to z ≃
        1.5, while its normalization keeps increasing with redshift;
        (ii) for the first time we are able to explore the FIR-radio
        correlation for a mass-selected sample of star-forming galaxies:
        the correlation does not evolve up to z ≃ 4; (iii) we confirm
        that galaxy stellar mass is a robust proxy for UV dust
        attenuation in star-forming galaxies, with more massive galaxies
        being more dust attenuated. Strikingly, we find that this
        attenuation relation evolves very weakly with redshift, with the
        amount of dust attenuation increasing by less than 0.3 mag over
        the redshift range [0.5-4] for a fixed stellar mass; (iv) the
        correlation between dust attenuation and the UV spectral slope
        evolves with redshift, with the median UV slope becoming bluer
        with redshift. By z ≃ 3, typical UV slopes are inconsistent,
        given the measured dust attenuations, with the predictions of
        commonly used empirical laws. (v) Finally, building on existing
        results, we show that gas reddening is marginally larger (by a
        factor of around 1.3) than the stellar reddening at all
        redshifts probed. Our results support a scenario where the ISM
        conditions of typical star-forming galaxies evolve with
        redshift, such that at z \ensuremath≥ 1.5 Main Sequence
        galaxies have ISM conditions moving closer to those of local
        starbursts. Based on observations collected at the Herschel,

    <p>We present an analysis of the deepest Herschel images in four major
        extragalactic fields GOODS-North, GOODS-South, UDS, and COSMOS
        obtained within the GOODS-Herschel and CANDELS-Herschel key
        programs. The star formation picture provided by a total of 10
        497 individual far-infrared detections is supplemented by the
        stacking analysis of a mass complete sample of 62 361 star-
        forming galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) H band-
        selected catalogs of the CANDELS survey and from two deep
        ground-based K_s band-selected catalogs in the GOODS-North
        and the COSMOS-wide field to obtain one of the most accurate and
        unbiased understanding to date of the stellar mass growth over
        the cosmic history. We show, for the first time, that stacking
        also provides a powerful tool to determine the dispersion of a
        physical correlation and describe our method called “scatter
        stacking”, which may be easily generalized to other
        experiments. The combination of direct UV and far-infrared UV-
        reprocessed light provides a complete census on the star
        formation rates (SFRs), allowing us to demonstrate that galaxies
        at z = 4 to 0 of all stellar masses (M_\ensuremath*)
        follow a universal scaling law, the so-called main sequence of
        star-forming galaxies. We find a universal close-to-linear slope
        of the log _10(SFR)-log _10(M_\ensuremath*)
        relation, with evidence for a flattening of the main sequence at
        high masses (log _10(M_\ensuremath*/M_☉) &gt;
        10.5) that becomesless prominent with increasing redshift and
        almost vanishes by z ≃ 2. This flattening may be due to the
        parallel stellar growth of quiescent bulges in star-forming
        galaxies, which mostly happens over the same redshift range.
        Within the main sequence, we measure a nonvarying SFR dispersion
        of 0.3 dex: at a fixed redshift and stellar mass, about 68% of
        star-forming galaxies form stars at a universal rate within a
        factor 2. The specific SFR (sSFR = SFR/M_\ensuremath*)
        of star-forming galaxies is found to continuously increase from
        z = 0 to 4. Finally we discuss the implications of our findings
        on the cosmic SFR history and on the origin of present-day
        stars: more than two-thirds of present-day stars must have
        formed in a regime dominated by the “main sequence” mode. As a
        consequence we conclude that, although omnipresent in the
        distant Universe, galaxy mergers had little impact in shaping
        the global star formation history over the last 12.5 billion
        years. Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science
        instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator
        consortia and with important participation from NASA.Appendices

    <p>We discuss the possibility of using fast radio bursts
        (FRBs)—if cosmological—as a viable
        cosmic probe. We find that the contribution of the host galaxies
        to the detected dispersion measures can be inapparent for the
        FRBs that are not from galaxy centers or star-forming regions.
        The inhomogeneity of the intergalactic medium (IGM), however,
        causes significant deviation of the dispersion measure from that
        predicted in the simplified homogeneous IGM model for an
        individual event. Fortunately, with sufficient FRBs along
        different sightlines but within a very narrow redshift interval
        (e.g., \ensuremath∆z ̃0.05), the mean obtained from
        averaging observed dispersion measures does not suffer such a
        problem and hence may be used as a cosmic probe. We show that in
        the optimistic case (e.g., about 20 FRBs in each
        \ensuremath∆z have been measured; the most distant FRBs
        were at redshift \ensuremath≥3; the host galaxies and the
        FRB sources contribute little to the detected dispersion
        measures) and with all the uncertainties (i.e., the
        inhomogeneity of the IGM, the contribution and uncertainty of
        host galaxies, and the evolution and error of f_IGM)
        considered, FRBs could help constrain the equation of state of
        dark energy.</p>

    <p>Starting from a sample of 24 \ensuremathμm sources in the Extended

    <p>Ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) are the most luminous and
        intense starburst galaxies in the Universe. Both their star
        formation rates and their gas surface mass densities are very
        high, implying a high supernova rate and an efficient energy
        conversion of energetic protons. A small fraction of these
        supernovae are the so-called hypernovae, with a typical kinetic
        energy ̃10^52erg and a shock velocity
        \ensuremath≥10^9cms^-1. The strong shocks
        driven by hypernovae are able to accelerate cosmic ray protons
        up to 10^17eV. These energetic protons lose a good
        fraction of their energy through proton-proton collision when
        ejected into very dense interstellar media, and as a result,
        produce high-energy neutrinos (\ensuremath≤5PeV). Recent
        deep infrared surveys provide solid constraints on the number
        density of ULIRGs across a wide redshift range
        0\ensuremath≤z\ensuremath≤2.3, allowing us to
        derive the flux of diffuse neutrinos from hypernovae. We find
        that at PeV energies, the diffuse neutrinos contributed by
        ULIRGs are comparable to atmosphere neutrinos with the flux of
        2\texttimes10^-9GeVcm^-2s^-1sr^-1 by assuming
        the injected cosmic ray spectrum to be dN_p^’/d\ensurem

    <p>We present a multi-wavelength study of a 3.6 \ensuremathμm
        selected galaxy sample in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). The
        sample is complete for galaxies with stellar mass
        &gt;10^9.5 M _☉ and redshift 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. In
        this redshift range, the Infrared Array Camera 3.6
        \ensuremathμm band measures the rest-frame near-infrared
        band, permitting nearly unbiased selection with respect to both
        quiescent and star-forming galaxies. The numerous spectroscopic
        redshifts available in the EGS are used to train an artificial
        neural network to estimate photometric redshifts. The
        distribution of photometric redshift errors is Gaussian with
        standard deviation \raisebox-0.5ex\textasciitilde0.025(1 + z),
        and the fraction of redshift failures
        (&gt;3\ensuremathσ errors) is about 3.5%. A new
        method of validation based on pair statistics confirms the
        estimate of standard deviation even for galaxies lacking
        spectroscopic redshifts. Basic galaxy properties measured
        include rest-frame U - B colors, B- and K-band absolute
        magnitudes, and stellar masses. We divide the sample into
        quiescent and star-forming galaxies according to their rest-
        frame U - B colors and 24-3.6 \ensuremathμm flux density
        ratios and derive rest K-band luminosity functions and stellar
        mass functions for quiescent, star-forming, and all galaxies.
        The results show that massive, quiescent galaxies were in place
        by z \ensuremath≈ 1, but lower mass galaxies generally
        ceased their star formation at later epochs.</p>

    <p>We present a study on spectral energy distributions, morphologies, and
        star formation for an IRAC-selected extremely red object sample
        in the GOODS Chandra Deep Field-South. This work was enabled by
        new HST/WFC3 near-IR imaging from the CANDELS survey as well as
        the deepest available X-ray data from Chandra 4 Ms observations.
        This sample consists of 133 objects with the 3.6
        \ensuremathμm limiting magnitude of [3.6] = 21.5 and is
        approximately complete for galaxies with M _* &gt;
        10^11 M _☉ at 1.5 &lt;= z &lt;= 2.5. We classify
        this sample into two types, quiescent and star-forming galaxies
        (SFGs), in the observed infrared color-color ([3.6]-[24] versus
        K - [3.6]) diagram. The further morphological study of this
        sample shows a consistent result with the observed color
        classification. The classified quiescent galaxies are bulge
        dominated and SFGs in the sample have disk or irregular
        morphologies. Our observed infrared color classification is also
        consistent with the rest-frame color (U - V versus V - J)
        classification. We also found that quiescent and SFGs are well
        separated in the nonparametric morphology parameter (Gini versus
        M _20) diagram measuring their concentration and clumpiness:
        quiescent galaxies have a Gini coefficient higher than 0.58 and
        SFGs have a Gini coefficient lower than 0.58. We argue that the
        star formation quenching process must lead to or be accompanied
        by the increasing galaxy concentration. One prominent
        morphological feature of this sample is that disks are commonly
        seen in this massive galaxy sample at 1.5 &lt;= z &lt;= 2.5:
        30% of quiescent galaxies and 70% of SFGs with M _* &gt;
        10^11 M _☉ have disks in their rest-frame optical
        morphologies. The prevalence of these extended, relatively
        undisturbed disks challenges the merging scenario as the main
        mode of massive galaxy formation.</p>

  <span class="abstract hidden">
    <p>The explosion of a Type Ia supernova, SN2011fe, in the nearby Pinwheel
        galaxy (M101 at 6.4 Mpc) provides an opportunity to study pre-
        explosion images and search for the progenitor, which should
        consist of a white dwarf (WD), possibly surrounded by an
        accretion disk, in orbit with another star. We report on our use
        of deep Chandra observations and Hubble Space Telescope
        observations to limit the luminosity and temperature of the pre-
        explosion WD. It is found that if the spectrum was a blackbody,
        then pre-SN WDs with steady nuclear burning of the highest
        possible temperatures and luminosities are excluded assuming
        moderate n _H values, but values of kT between roughly 10 eV
        and 60 eV are permitted even if the WD was emitting at the
        Eddington luminosity. This allows the progenitor to be an
        accreting nuclear-burning WD with an expanded photosphere 4-100
        times the WD itself, or a super-critically accreting WD blowing
        off an optically thick strong wind, or possibly a recurrent nova
        with luminosities an order of magnitude lower than Eddington.
        The observations are also consistent with a double degenerate
        scenario, or a spinning down WD that has been spun up by
        accretion from the donor.</p>

    <p>The ‘Eagle’ galaxy at a redshift of 0.77 is studied with
        the Oxford Short Wavelength Integral Field Spectrograph (SWIFT)
        and multiwavelength data from the All-wavelength Extended Groth
        strip International Survey (AEGIS). It was chosen from AEGIS
        because of the bright and extended emission in its slit
        spectrum. 3D kinematic maps of the Eagle reveal a gradient in
        velocity dispersion which spans 35-75 \ensuremath\pm 10 km
        s^-1 and a rotation velocity of 25 \ensuremath\pm 5 km
        s^-1 uncorrected for inclination. Hubble Space Telescope
        images suggest it is close to face-on. In comparison with
        galaxies from AEGIS at similar redshifts, the Eagle is extremely
        bright and blue in the rest-frame optical, highly star forming,
        dominated by unobscured star formation and has a low metallicity
        for its size. This is consistent with its selection. The Eagle
        is likely undergoing a major merger and is caught in the early
        stage of a starburst when it has not yet experienced metal
        enrichment or formed the mass of dust typically found in star-
        forming galaxies.</p>

    <p>We report the detection of four IRAC sources in the GOODS-South field
        with an extremely red color of H - [3.6] &gt; 4.5. The four
        sources are not detected in the deep Hubble Space Telescope WFC3
        H-band image with H _limit = 28.3 mag. We find that only
        three types of SED templates can produce such a red H - [3.6]
        color: a very dusty SED with the Calzetti extinction of A_V
        = 16 mag at z = 0.8; a very dusty SED with the SMC extinction of
        A_V = 8 mag at z = 2.0- 2.2; and an 1 Gyr SSP with A_V
        \raisebox-0.5ex~0.8 at z = 5.7. We argue that
        these sources are unlikely dusty galaxies at z &lt;= 2.2 based
        on absent strong MIPS 24 \ensuremathμm emission. The old
        stellar population model at z &gt; 4.5 remains a possible
        solution for the 4 sources. At z &gt; 4.5, these sources have
        stellar masses of log(M _*/M _☉) = 10.6-11.2. One
        source, ERS-1, is also a type-II X-ray QSO with L _2 - 8 keV
        = 1.6 \texttimes 10^44 erg s^-1. One of the four
        sources is an X-ray QSO and another one is a HyperLIRG,
        suggesting a galaxy-merging scenario for the formation of these
        massive galaxies at high redshifts.</p>

    <p>In order to find the physical parameters which determine the accuracy of
        photometric redshifts, we compare the spectroscopic and
        photometric redshifts (photo-z’s) for a large sample of
        \raisebox-0.5ex~80000 SDSS-2MASS galaxies.
        Photo-z’s in this paper are estimated by using the artificial
        neural network photometric redshift method (ANNz). For a subset
        of \raisebox-0.5ex\textasciitilde40000 randomly selected
        galaxies, we find that the photometric redshift recovers the
        spectroscopic redshift distribution very well with rms of 0.016.
        Our main results are as follows: (1) Using magnitudes directly
        as input parameters produces more accurate photo-z’s than using
        colors; (2) The inclusion of 2MASS (J, H, K_s) bands does
        not improve photo-z’s significantly, which indicates that near
        infrared data might not be important for the low-redshift
        sample; (3) Adding the concentration index (essentially the
        steepness of the galaxy brightness profile) as an extra input
        can improve the photo-z’s estimation up to
        \raisebox-0.5ex~10 percent; (4) Dividing the
        sample into early- and late-type galaxies by using the
        concentration index, normal and abnormal galaxies by using the
        emission line flux ratios, and red and blue galaxies by using
        color index (g - r), we can improve the accuracy of photo-z’s
        significantly; (5) Our analysis shows that the outliers (where
        there is a big difference between the spectroscopic and
        photometric redshifts) are mainly correlated with galaxy types,
        e.g., most outliers are late-type (blue) galaxies.</p>
