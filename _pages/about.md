This is Tao Wang (王涛). I am currently a post-doc researcher in astrophysics at Institute of Astronomy, University of Tokyo. I got my Ph. D in Astrophysics from Nanjing University, China in 2012, after spending two years at Harvard-Smithonian Center for Astrophysics as a pre-doctoral student. Before joining University of Tokyo, I was a post-doc at Commissariat à l'énergie atomique (CEA), Saclay, France.

My main research interests include galaxy formation, active galactic nuclei, galaxy clusters and cosmology, with a special emphasis on the early universe.
