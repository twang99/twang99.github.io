This is Tao Wang (王涛). I am currently a post-doc researcher in astrophysics at Institute of Astronomy, University of Tokyo. I got my Ph. D in Astrophysics from Nanjing University, China in 2012, after spending two years at Harvard-Smithonian Center for Astrophysics as a pre-doctoral student. Before joining University of Tokyo, I was a post-doc at Commissariat à l'énergie atomique (CEA), Saclay, France.

I mainly study the formation and evoultion of galaxies, including the origin of their diverse morphologies (Hubble Sequence), the co-evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes, and the connection between galaxies and their local environment (galaxy clusters and large scale structures). To this aim, I conduct multi-wavelength observations using the largest telescopes in space and on the ground, to detect and characterize the emission of stars, dust/gas, and black holes in galaxies.
