        Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm survey. One has a red IRAC (3.6 and 4.5

        independently detected at 850 and 870 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m using
        SCUBA2 and ALMA Band 7, respectively. Their optical-to-radio
        spectral energy distributions indicate that they can lie at z

        Considering four separate redshift bins with

        populations, i.e., red sequence (RS), blue cloud (BC), and green

        populations are confirmed to be dependent on their rest-frame UV
        color and redshift: UV redder galaxies are found to be more
        clustered. In all redshift bins, the GV galaxies generally have
        medium clustering amplitudes and are hosted within dark matter
        halos whose masses are more or less between those of RS and BC
        galaxies; and the clustering amplitude of GV galaxies is close
        to that of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the same redshift

        transforming galaxy colors. After carefully examining their

        three typical $z \sim 3$ star-forming galaxies in the Hubble
        Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF). The cold dust is distributed within the
        smooth disk-like central regions of star formation (SF) $1 - 3$
        kpc in diameter, despite their complex and disturbed rest-frame

        seen down to $\simeq 1- 3$ $M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ (1$\sigma$) per

        and well-understood evolution of the interstellar medium from
        the present to z = 2, we investigate the behaviour of the [C II]
        emission and empirically identify its primary driver. We detect
        [C II] from six galaxies (four secure and two tentative) and
        estimate ensemble averages including non-detections. The [C II

        is similar to that of local main-sequence galaxies (̃2

        starbursts. The [C II] emission has an average spatial extent of
        4-7 kpc, consistent with the optical size. Complementing our
        sample with literature data, we find that the [C II] luminosity
        correlates with galaxies' molecular gas mass, with a mean
        absolute deviation of 0.2 dex and without evident systematics:
        the [C II]-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factor ({\ensuremath{\alpha}}
        \_[C II] ̃ 30 M$_{☉}$/L$_{☉}$) is largely independent of
        galaxies' depletion time, metallicity, and redshift. [C II]
        seems therefore a convenient tracer to estimate galaxies'
        molecular gas content regardless of their starburst or main-
        sequence nature, and extending to metal-poor galaxies at low and
        high redshifts. The dearth of [C II] emission reported for z

        efficiency or a small fraction of ultraviolet light from star
        formation reprocessed by dust.}",

        South field. <BR /> Methods: We tapered the 0″24 original image
        with a homogeneous and circular synthesized beam of 0″60 to
        reduce the number of independent beams - thus reducing the
        number of purely statistical spurious detections - and optimize

        without HST counterparts down to a 5{\ensuremath{\sigma}}
        limiting depth of H = 28.2 AB (HST/WFC3 F160W). <BR /> Results:
        ALMA detects 20 sources brighter than 0.7 mJy at 1.1 mm in the
        0″60 tapered mosaic (rms sensitivity {\ensuremath{\sigma}} ≃
        0.18 mJy beam$^{-1}$) with a purity greater than 80\%. Among

        spurious galaxies from the analysis of the inverted image; their
        definitive status will require additional investigation. We

        high significance in the higher resolution map, or with
        different detection-algorithm parameters ensuring a purity
        greater than 80\%. Hence we identify in total 20 robust
        detections. <BR /> Conclusions: Our wide contiguous survey
        allows us to push further in redshift the blind detection of
        massive galaxies with ALMA with a median redshift of z = 2.92
        and a median stellar mass of M$_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ = 1.1

        of two of them (z ̃ 4.3 and 4.8) suggest that these sources have

        attenuation, IR luminosity, and star-formation rate (SFR). The
        AGN properties are inferred from the X-ray spectral analysis and
        radio observations, and its contribution to the total IR
        luminosity is estimated from the broadband SED fittings using
        MAGPHYS. <BR /> Results: With the new NOEMA interferometric
        imaging, we confirm that the source is a unique dusty galaxy. It
        has no obvious counterpart in the optical and even NIR images
        observed with HST at {\ensuremath{\lambda}}
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 1.4 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m. Photometric-
        redshift analyses from both stellar and dust SED suggest it to
        likely be at z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 4, though a lower redshift
        at z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 3.1 cannot be fully ruled out (at
        90\% confidence interval). Explaining its unusual optical-to-NIR
        properties requires an old stellar population (̃0.67 Gyr),
        coexisting with a very dusty ongoing starburst component. The
        latter is contributing to the FIR emission, with its rest-frame
        UV and optical light being largely obscured along our line of
        sight. If the observed fluxes at the rest-frame optical/NIR
        wavelengths were mainly contributed by old stars, a total
        stellar mass of ̃3.5 {\texttimes} {}10$^{11}$ M$_{☉}$ would be
        obtained. An X-ray spectral analysis suggests that this galaxy
        harbors a heavily obscured AGN with N$_{H}$ =
        3.3$^{+2.0}$$_{-1.7}$ {\texttimes} {}10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and an
        intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of L$_{x}$ ̃ 2.6 {\texttimes}
        {}10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which places this object among distant
        type 2 quasars. The radio emission of the source is extremely
        bright, which is an order of magnitude higher than the star-
        formation-powered emission, making it one of the most distant
        radio-luminous dusty galaxies. <BR /> Conclusions: The combined
        characteristics of the galaxy suggest that the source appears to
        have been caught in a rare but critical transition stage in the
        evolution of submillimeter galaxies, where we are witnessing the
        birth of a young AGN and possibly the earliest stage of its jet
        formation and feedback.}",

        CO(1-0) measurements. We find a large variety in the gas content
        of these cluster galaxies, which is correlated with their
        relative positions (or accretion states), with those closer to
        the cluster core being increasingly gas-poor. Moreover, despite
        their low gas content, the galaxies in the cluster center
        exhibit an elevated star formation efficiency (SFE; SFE = SFR/M

        suppression on the SFR is likely delayed compared to that on the
        gas content. Their gas depletion time is around t $_{dep}$ ̃ 400
        Myr, which is comparable to the cluster dynamical time. This
        implies that they will consume all of their gas within a single
        orbit around the cluster center, and form a passive cluster core

        resolution in order to resolve star formation in a sample of
        eight star-forming galaxies at z 2 selected among the most

        is supplemented with eleven galaxies from the public data of the
        1.3 mm survey of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, HUDF. We derive
        dust and gas masses for the galaxies, compute their depletion
        times and gas fractions, and study the relative distributions of
        rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and far-infrared (FIR) light. <BR />
        Results: ALMA reveals systematically dense concentrations of
        dusty star formation close to the center of the stellar
        component of the galaxies. We identify two different starburst
        regimes: (i) the classical population of starbursts located
        above the SFR-M$_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ main sequence, with
        enhanced gas fractions and short depletion times and (ii) a sub-
        population of galaxies located within the scatter of the main
        sequence that experience compact star formation with depletion
        timescales typical of starbursts of 150 Myr. In both starburst
        populations, the FIR and UV are distributed in distinct regions
        and dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) estimated using
        UV-optical-near-infrared data alone underestimate the total SFR.
        Starbursts hidden in the main sequence show instead the lowest
        gas fractions of our sample and could represent the last stage
        of star formation prior to passivization. Being Herschel-
        selected, these main sequence galaxies are located in the high-
        mass end of the main sequence, hence we do not know whether
        these ``starbursts hidden in the main sequence'' also exist
        below {}10$^{11}$ M$_{☉}$. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are
        found to be ubiquitous in these compact starbursts, suggesting
        that the triggering mechanism also feeds the central black hole
        or that the active nucleus triggers star formation.}",

        provide us with a radial profile of the total star formation
        rate (SFR), where the infrared SFR dominates over the UV SFR at
        the center. Under the assumption of a constant SFR, a compact
        stellar distribution in z ̃ 1-2 compact quiescent galaxies
        (cQGs) is well reproduced, while a spheroidal stellar morphology
        of cQGs (n $_{opt}$ = 4) is not, suggestive of other important

        few hundred million years. The study of the physical processes
        linked to these rapid variations requires large statistical
        samples to pinpoint galaxies undergoing such transformations.
        Building upon a previous study, we define a method to blindly
        identify galaxies that have undergone, and may still be
        undergoing, a fast downfall of their star formation activity,
        that is, a more than 80\% drop in star formation rate (SFR)
        occurring in less than 500 Myr. Modeling galaxies' spectral
        energy distribution (SED) with a delayed-{\ensuremath{\tau}}
        star formation history, with and without allowing an
        instantaneous SFR drop within the last hundred million years, we
        isolate 102 candidates out of a subsample of 6680 galaxies
        classified as ``star forming'' from the UVJ criterion in the
        ZFOURGE catalogs. These galaxies are mostly located in the lower
        part of the SFR-M$_{*}$ main sequence (MS) and extend up to a
        factor 100 below it. They also lie close to the limit between
        the passive and active regions on the UVJ diagram, indicating
        that they are in a transition phase. We show that the selected
        candidates have different physical properties compared to
        galaxies with similar UVJ colors, namely, lower SFRs and
        different stellar masses. The morphology of the candidates shows
        no preference for a particular type. Among the 102 candidates,
        only 4 show signs of a active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity
        (from X-ray luminosity or ultraviolet-infrared (UV-IR) SED
        fitting decomposition). This low fraction of AGNs among the
        candidates implies that AGN activity may not be the main driver
        of the recent downfall, although timescale differences and duty
        cycle must be taken into account. We finally attempt to recover
        the past position of these galaxies on the SFR-M$_{*}$ plane,
        before the downfall of their star formation and show that some
        of them were in the starburst region before, and are now back on
        the MS. These candidates constitute a promising sample that
        needs more investigation in order to understand the different
        mechanisms at the origin of the star formation decrease of the
        Universe since z 2.}",

        compact (r$_{1/2}$ = 0.67 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.14 kpc) and
        extremely obscured galaxy (A$_{V}$ 3.5), located only 0.43``
        (3.1 kpc) away from the quiescent galaxy. We dub the quiescent
        and dusty galaxies Jekyll and Hyde, respectively. No dust
        emission is detected at the location of the quiescent galaxy,
        implying SFR \&lt; 13 M$_{☉}$ yr$^{-1}$ which is the most
        stringent upper limit ever obtained for a quiescent galaxy at
        these redshifts. The two sources are spectroscopically confirmed
        to lie at the same redshift thanks to the detection of [C
        II]$_{158}$ in Hyde (z = 3.709), which provides one the few
        robust redshifts for a highly-obscured ''H-dropout`` galaxy (H -
        [4.5] = 5.1 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.8). The [C II] line shows a
        clear rotating-disk velocity profile which is blueshifted
        compared to the Balmer lines of Jekyll by 549 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        60 km s$^{-1}$, demonstrating that it is produced by another
        galaxy. Careful de-blending of the Spitzer imaging confirms the
        existence of this new massive galaxy, and its non-detection in
        the Hubble images requires extremely red colors and strong
        attenuation by dust. Full modeling of the UV-to-far-IR emission
        of both galaxies shows that Jekyll has fully quenched at least
        200Myr prior to observation and still presents a challenge for
        models, while Hyde only harbors moderate star-formation with SFR
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 120 M$_{☉}$ yr$^{-1}$, and is located at
        least a factor 1.4 below the z 4 main sequence. Hyde could also
        have stopped forming stars less than 200 Myr before being
        observed; this interpretation is also suggested by its
        compactness comparable to that of z 4 quiescent galaxies and its
        low [C II]/FIR ratio, but significant on-going star-formation
        cannot be ruled out. Lastly, we find that despite its moderate
        SFR, Hyde hosts a dense reservoir of gas comparable to that of
        the most extreme starbursts. This suggests that whatever
        mechanism has stopped or reduced its star-formation must have
        done so without expelling the gas outside of the galaxy. Because
        of their surprisingly similar mass, compactness, environment and
        star-formation history, we argue that Jekyll and Hyde can be
        seen as two stages of the same quenching process, and provide a
        unique laboratory to study this poorly understood phenomenon.

        Large Array (VLA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
        Array (ALMA) observations in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field and
        COSMOS, with the centimetric radio emission tracing both star
        formation and AGN, and the sub/millimeter emission by dust
        tracing nearly pure star formation. We require radio emission to
        be {\ensuremath{\geq}}slant 5{\texttimes} more luminous than the
        level associated with the sub/millimeter star formation to
        ensure that the radio emission is AGN-dominated, thereby
        allowing localization of the AGN and star formation
        independently. In all three galaxies, the AGNs are located
        within the compact regions of gas-rich, heavily obscured,
        intense nuclear star formation, with R $_{ e }$ = 0.4-1.1 kpc

        (sub-)millimeter (mm) data in the northern field of the Great
        Observatories Origins Deep Survey. There are two key novelties.
        First, starting with a large database of deep Spitzer 24
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m and VLA 20 cm detections that are used to
        define prior positions for fitting the FIR/submm data, we
        perform an active selection of useful priors independently at
        each frequency band, moving from less to more confused bands.
        Exploiting knowledge of redshift and all available photometry,
        we identify hopelessly faint priors that we remove from the
        fitting pool. This approach significantly reduces blending
        degeneracies and allows reliable photometry to be obtained for
        galaxies in FIR+mm bands. Second, we obtain well-behaved, nearly
        Gaussian flux density uncertainties, individually tailored to
        all fitted priors for each band. This is done by exploiting
        extensive simulations that allow us to calibrate the conversion
        of formal fitting uncertainties to realistic uncertainties,
        depending on directly measurable quantities. We achieve deeper
        detection limits with high fidelity measurements and
        uncertainties at FIR+mm bands. As an illustration of the utility
        of these measurements, we identify 70 galaxies with
        z{\ensuremath{\geq}}slant 3 and reliable FIR+mm detections. We
        present new constraints on the cosmic star formation rate
        density at 3\&lt; z\&lt; 6, finding a significant contribution
        from z{\ensuremath{\geq}}slant 3 dusty galaxies that are missed
        by optical-to-near-infrared color selection. Photometric
        measurements for 3306 priors, including more than 1000 FIR+mm
        detections, are released publicly with our catalog.}",

     abstract = "{We present a new, publicly available library of dust spectral energy
        distributions (SEDs). These SEDs are characterized by only three
        parameters: the dust mass (M$_{dust}$), the dust temperature
        (T$_{dust}$), and the mid-to-total infrared color (IR8
        {\ensuremath{\equiv}} L$_{IR}$/L$_{8}$). The latter measures the
        relative contribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
        molecules to the total infrared luminosity. We used this library
        to model star-forming galaxies at 0.5 \&lt; z \&lt; 4 in the
        deep CANDELS fields, using both individual detections and stacks
        of Herschel and ALMA imaging, and extending this sample to z = 0
        using the Herschel Reference Survey. At first order, the dust
        SED of a galaxy was observed to be independent of stellar mass,
        but evolving with redshift. We found trends of increasing
        T$_{dust}$ and IR8 with redshift and distance from the
        SFR-M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$ main sequence, and quantified for the
        first time their intrinsic scatter. Half of the observed
        variations of these parameters was captured by the above
        empirical relations, and after subtracting the measurement
        errors we found residual scatters of
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}T$_{dust}$/T$_{dust}$ = 12\% and
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}log IR8 = 0.18 dex. We observed second
        order variations with stellar mass: massive galaxies
        (M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$ \&gt; {}10$^{11}$M$_{☉}$) at z
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} 1 have slightly lower temperatures
        indicative of a reduced star formation efficiency, while low
        mass galaxies (M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$ \&lt; {}10$^{10}$M$_{☉}$)
        at z {\ensuremath{\geq}} 1 showed reduced PAH emission, possibly
        linked to their lower metallicities. Building on these results,
        we constructed high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogs to predict the
        accuracy of infrared luminosities and dust masses determined
        using a single broadband measurement. Using a single James Webb
        Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI band, we found that L$_{IR}$ is
        typically uncertain by 0.15 dex, with a maximum of 0.25 dex when
        probing the rest-frame 8 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m, and this is not
        significantly impacted by typical redshift uncertainties. On the
        other hand, we found that ALMA bands 8 to 7 and 6 to 3 measured
        the dust mass at better than 0.2 and 0.15 dex, respectively, and
        independently of redshift, while bands 9 to 6 only measured
        L$_{IR}$ at better than 0.2 dex at z \&gt; 1, 3.2, 3.8, and 5.7,
        respectively. Starburst galaxies had their L$_{IR}$
        significantly underestimated when measured by a single JWST or
        ALMA band, while their dust mass from a single ALMA band were
        moderately overestimated. This dust library and the results of
        this paper can be used immediately to improve the design of
        observing proposals, and interpret more accurately the large
        amount of archival data from Spitzer, Herschel and ALMA. The

        use CANDELS HST catalogues, ultra-deep Ks data and new IRAC
        photometry, performing spectral energy distribution fitting
        using models with abruptly quenched star formation histories. We
        then single out galaxies which are best fitted by a passively
        evolving model, and having only low probability (\&lt;5 per
        cent) star-forming solutions. We verify the effects of including
        nebular lines emission, and we consider possible solutions at
        different redshifts. The number of selected sources dramatically
        depends on the models used in the spectral energy distribution
        (SED) fitting. Without including emission lines and with
        photometric redshifts fixed at the CANDELS estimate, we single
        out 30 candidates; the inclusion of nebular lines emission
        reduces the sample to 10 objects; allowing for solutions at

        assumptions in the SED modelling adopted and to the relatively
        low S/N of the objects. By means of dedicated simulations, we

        among the four strongest projected overdensities. We conclude
        that there are great prospects for future deep and wide-area
        radio surveys to discover large samples of the first generation
        of forming galaxy clusters. In these remarkable structures,
        widespread star formation and AGN activity of massive galaxy
        cluster members, residing within the inner cluster core, will
        ultimately lead to radio continuum as one of the most effective
        means for their identification, with detection rates expected in
        the ballpark of 0.1-1 per square degree at
        z{\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 2.5. Samples of hundreds such high-
        redshift clusters could potentially constrain cosmological
        parameters and test cluster and galaxy formation models.}",

        properties to the CO(5-4) emission on scales of a few

        region of the galaxy, consistent with the observed L$_{IR}$-L\^'

        formation. The CO(5-4) gas component appears more concentrated
        than other star formation tracers or the dust distribution in
        this galaxy. We discuss possible implications of this difference
        in terms of star formation efficiency and mass build-up at the
        galaxy centre. Conversely, we do not detect any CO(5-4) emission
        from the UV-bright clumps. This might imply that clumps have a
        high star formation efficiency (although they do not display
        unusually high specific star formation rates) and are not
        entirely gas dominated, with gas fractions no larger than that
        of their host galaxy (̃50 per cent). Stellar feedback and disc
        instability torques funnelling gas towards the galaxy centre
        could contribute to the relatively low gas content.
        Alternatively, clumps could fall in a more standard star
        formation efficiency regime if their actual star formation rates
        are lower than generally assumed. We find that clump star
        formation rates derived with several different, plausible
        methods can vary by up to an order of magnitude. The lowest
        estimates would be compatible with a CO(5-4) non-detection even

        designed within the ASTRODEEP collaboration to generate mock
        galaxy catalogs for deep fields with realistic fluxes and simple
        morphologies. The simulation procedure is based exclusively on
        empirical prescriptions - rather than first principles - to
        provide the most accurate match with current observations at 0
        \&lt;z\&lt; 7. We considered that galaxies can be either
        quiescent or star-forming, and used their stellar mass
        (M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$) and redshift (z) as the fundamental
        properties from which all the other observables can be
        statistically derived. Drawing z and M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$ from
        the observed galaxy stellar mass functions, a star-formation
        rate (SFR) is attributed to each galaxy from the tight
        SFR-M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$ main sequence, while dust
        attenuation, optical colors and simple disk plus bulge
        morphologies are obtained from empirical relations that we
        established from the high quality Hubble and Herschel
        observations from the CANDELS fields. Random scatter was
        introduced in each step to reproduce the observed distributions
        of each parameter. Based on these observables, an adequate
        panchromatic spectral energy distribution (SED) is selected for
        each galaxy and synthetic photometry is produced by integrating
        the redshifted SED in common broad-band filters. Finally, the
        mock galaxies are placed on the sky at random positions with a
        fixed angular two-point correlation function to implement basic
        clustering. The resulting flux catalogs reproduce accurately the
        observed number counts in all broad bands from the ultraviolet
        up to the sub-millimeter, and can be directly fed to image
        simulators such as SkyMaker. The images can then be used to test
        source extraction softwares and image-based techniques such as
        stacking. EGG is open-source, and is made available to the

        (L$_{0.5-8 keV}$ = 10$^{41.9-43.7}$ erg s$^{-1}$) active
        galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the distribution of their accretion
        rates on host color at 0.5 \&lt;z \&lt; 2.5. Based on the
        deepest X-ray and UV-to-far-infrared data in the two The Great
        Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) fields, we identify
        221 AGNs within a mass-complete parent galaxy sample down to
        M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$ \&gt; {}10$^{10}$ M$_{☉}$. We use
        extinction-corrected rest-frame U-V colors to divide both AGN
        hosts and non-AGN galaxies into red sequence (red), green valley
        (green), and blue cloud (blue) populations. We find that the
        fraction of galaxies hosting an AGN at fixed X-ray luminosity
        increases with stellar mass and redshift for all the three
        galaxy populations, independent of their colors. However, both
        the AGN fraction at fixed stellar mass and its evolution with
        redshift are clearly dependent on host colors. Most notably, red
        galaxies have the lowest AGN fraction ( 5\%) at z 1 yet with
        most rapid evolution with redshift, increasing by a factor of 5
        (24\%) at z 2. Green galaxies exhibit the highest AGN fraction
        across all redshifts, which is most pronounced at z 2 with more
        than half of them hosting an AGN at M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$ \&gt;
        10$^{10.6}$ M$_{☉}$. Together with the high AGN fraction in red
        galaxies at z 2, this indicates that (X-ray) AGNs could be
        important in both transforming (quenching) star-forming galaxies
        into quiescent ones and subsequently maintaining their
        quiescence at high redshift. Furthermore, consistent with
        previous studies at lower redshifts, we show that the
        probability of hosting an AGN for the total galaxy population
        can be characterized by a universal Eddington ratio (as
        approximated by L$_{X}$/M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$) distribution
        (p({\ensuremath{\lambda}}$_{Edd}$)
        {\ensuremath{\lambda}}$_{Edd}$$^{-0.4}$), which is independent
        on host mass. Yet consistent with their different AGN fractions,
        galaxies with different colors appear to also have different
        p({\ensuremath{\lambda}}$_{Edd}$) with red galaxies exhibiting
        more rapid redshift evolution compared with that for green and
        blue galaxies. Evidence for a steeper power-law distribution of
        p({\ensuremath{\lambda}}$_{Edd}$) in red galaxies
        (p({\ensuremath{\lambda}}$_{Edd}$)
        {\ensuremath{\lambda}}$_{Edd}$$^{-0.6}$) is also presented,
        though larger samples are needed to confirm. These results
        suggest that the AGN accretion or the growth of supermassive
        black holes is related to their host properties, and may also
        influence their hosts in a different mode dependent on the host
        color.}",

        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m (180 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m rest-frame) with an
        on-source integration time of 1.3 min per galaxy. We detected

        significance. Using the stacked ALMA and Herschel photometry, we
        derived an average dust temperature of 40 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2 K
        for the whole sample, and extrapolate the L$_{IR}$ and SFR for
        all our galaxies based on their ALMA flux. We then used a
        forward modeling approach to estimate their intrinsic sSFR
        distribution, deconvolved of measurement errors and selection
        effects: we find a linear relation between SFR and
        M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$, with a median sSFR = 2.8

        of 0.28 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.13 dex. This latter value is
        consistent with that measured at lower redshifts, which is proof
        that the main sequence of star-forming galaxies was already in
        place at z = 4, at least among massive galaxies. These new
        constraints on the properties of the main sequence are in good
        agreement with the latest predictions from numerical
        simulations, and suggest that the bulk of star formation in
        galaxies is driven by the same mechanism from z = 4 to the
        present day, that is, over at least 90\% of the cosmic history.
        We also discuss the consequences of our results on the
        population of early quiescent galaxies. This paper is part of a

        it the most distant X-ray-detected cluster known to date. Unlike
        other clusters discovered so far, this structure is dominated by
        star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the core with only 2 out of the
        11 massive galaxies classified as quiescent. The star formation
        rate (SFR) in the 80 kpc core reaches ̃3400 M $_{☉}$ yr$^{-1}$

        this cluster in rapid build-up of a dense core. The high SFR is
        driven by both a high abundance of SFGs and a higher starburst
        fraction (̃25\%, compared to 3\%-5\% in the field). The presence

        accrete onto the cluster, providing new insights into massive

        the 34,930 CANDELS H-band selected galaxies. For each detected
        source we provide X-ray photometry and optical counterpart
        validation. We validated this technique by means of a ray-
        tracing simulation. We detected a total of 698 X-ray point
        sources with a likelihood \{ L \}\textbackslashgt 4.98 (I.e.,
        \&gt;2.7{\ensuremath{\sigma}}). We show that prior knowledge of
        a deep sample of optical-NIR galaxies leads to a significant
        increase in the detection of faint (I.e., ̃10$^{-17}$ cgs in the
        [0.5-2] keV band) sources with respect to
        {\textquotedblleft}blind{\textquotedblright} X-ray detections.
        By including previous X-ray catalogs, this work increases the
        total number of X-ray sources detected in the 4 Ms CDFS, CANDELS
        area to 793, which represents the largest sample of extremely
        faint X-ray sources assembled to date. Our results suggest that
        a large fraction of the optical counterparts of our X-ray
        sources determined by likelihood ratio actually coincides with
        the priors used for the source detection. Most of the new
        detected sources are likely SFGs or faint, absorbed AGNs. We
        identified a few sources with putative photometric redshift z
        \&gt; 4. Despite the low number statistics and the uncertainties
        on the photo z, this sample significantly increases the number
        of X-ray-selected candidate high-z AGNs.}",

     abstract = "{We study the causes of the reported mass-dependence in the slope of the
        SFR-M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$ relation, the so-called main sequence
        of star-forming galaxies, and discuss its implication on the
        physical processes that shaped the star formation history of
        massive galaxies over cosmic time. We made use of the near-
        infrared high-resolution imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope
        in the CANDELS fields to perform a careful bulge-to-disk
        decomposition of distant galaxies and measure for the first time
        the slope of the SFR-M$_{disk}$ relation at z = 1. We find that
        this relation very closely follows the shape of the nominal
        SFR-M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$ correlation, still with a pronounced
        flattening at the high-mass end. This clearly excludes, at least
        at z = 1, the progressive growth of quiescent stellar bulges in
        star-forming galaxies as the main driver for the change of slope
        of the main sequence. Then, by stacking the Herschel data
        available in the CANDELS field, we estimated the gas mass
        (M$_{gas}$ = M$_{H I}$ + M$_{H<SUB>2}$</SUB>) and the star
        formation efficiency (SFE {\ensuremath{\equiv}} SFR/M$_{gas}$)
        at different positions on the SFR-M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$
        relation. We find that the relatively low SFRs observed in
        massive galaxies (M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$\&gt; 5 {\texttimes}
        {}10$^{10}$ M$_{☉}$) are not caused by a reduced gas content,
        but by a star formation efficiency that is lower by up to a
        factor of 3 than in galaxies with lower stellar mass. The trend
        at the lowest masses is probably linked to the dominance of
        atomic over molecular gas. We argue that this stellar-mass-
        dependent SFE can explain the varying slope of the main sequence
        since z = 1.5, hence over 70\% of the Hubble time. The drop in
        SFE occurs at lower masses in the local Universe
        (M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$\&gt; 2 {\texttimes} {}10$^{10}$ M$_{☉}$)
        and is not present at z = 2. Altogether, this provides evidence
        for a slow decrease in star formation efficiency in massive main
        sequence galaxies. The resulting loss of star formation is found
        to be rising starting from z = 2 to reach a level similar to the
        mass growth of the quiescent population by z = 1. We finally
        discuss the possible physical origin of this phenomenon.}",

     abstract = "{Context. The Frontier Fields survey is a pioneering observational
        program aimed at collecting photometric data, both from space
        (Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope) and from
        ground-based facilities (VLT Hawk-I), for six deep fields
        pointing at clusters of galaxies and six nearby deep parallel
        fields, in a wide range of passbands. The analysis of these data
        is a natural outcome of the Astrodeep project, an EU
        collaboration aimed at developing methods and tools for
        extragalactic photometry and creating valuable public
        photometric catalogues. <BR /> Aims: We produce multiwavelength
        photometric catalogues (from B to 4.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) for
        the first two of the Frontier Fields, Abell-2744 and MACS-J0416
        (plus their parallel fields). <BR /> Methods: To detect faint
        sources even in the central regions of the clusters, we develop
        a robust and repeatable procedure that uses the public codes
        Galapagos and Galfit to model and remove most of the light
        contribution from both the brightest cluster members, and the
        intra-cluster light. We perform the detection on the processed
        HST H160 image to obtain a pure H-selected sample, which is the
        primary catalogue that we publish. We also add a sample of
        sources which are undetected in the H160 image but appear on a
        stacked infrared image. Photometry on the other HST bands is
        obtained using SExtractor, again on processed images after the
        procedure for foreground light removal. Photometry on the Hawk-I
        and IRAC bands is obtained using our PSF-matching deconfusion
        code t-phot. A similar procedure, but without the need for the
        foreground light removal, is adopted for the Parallel fields.
        <BR /> Results: The procedure of foreground light subtraction
        allows for the detection and the photometric measurements of
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde2500 sources per field. We
        deliver and release complete photometric H-detected catalogues,
        with the addition of the complementary sample of infrared-
        detected sources. All objects have multiwavelength coverage
        including B to H HST bands, plus K-band from Hawk-I, and 3.6-4.5
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m from Spitzer. full and detailed treatment of
        photometric errors is included. We perform basic sanity checks
        on the reliability of our results. <BR /> Conclusions: The
        multiwavelength photometric catalogues are available publicly
        and are ready to be used for scientific purposes. Our procedures
        allows for the detection of outshone objects near the bright
        galaxies, which, coupled with the magnification effect of the
        clusters, can reveal extremely faint high redshift sources. Full
        analysis on photometric redshifts is presented in Paper II. The

        based K and Spitzer IRAC, which is specifically designed to
        enable detection and measurement of accurate fluxes in crowded
        cluster regions. The multiband information is used to derive
        photometric redshifts and physical properties of sources
        detected either in the H-band image alone, or from a stack of
        four WFC3 bands. To minimize systematics, median photometric
        redshifts are assembled from six different approaches to photo-z
        estimates. Their reliability is assessed through a comparison
        with available spectroscopic samples. State-of-the-art lensing

        of 2 kpc, including ̃ 20\% as compact as quiescent (QS) galaxies
        at similar redshifts, \{JH\}-\{blue\} HIEROs represent perfect

        technique. Potential high-z sources are selected against low-
        redshift ones from their large 500 to 24 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m
        flux density ratios. By effectively reducing the contribution
        from low-redshift populations to the observed 500
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m emission, we are able to identify
        counterparts to high-z 500 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m sources whose 24
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m fluxes are relatively faint. The recovery of
        known z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 4 starbursts confirms the
        efficiency of this approach in selecting high-z Herschel
        sources. The resulting sample consists of 34 dusty star-forming
        galaxies at z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 2. The inferred infrared
        luminosities are in the range 1.5 {\texttimes} {}10$^{12}$-1.8
        {\texttimes} {}10$^{13}$ L$_{☉}$, corresponding to dust-obscured
        star formation rates (SFRs) of ̃260-3100 M$_{☉}$ yr$^{-1}$ for a
        Salpeter initial mass function. Comparison with previous SCUBA
        850 {\ensuremath{\mu}} \{\{m\}\}-selected galaxy samples shows
        that our method is more efficient at selecting high-z dusty
        galaxies, with a median redshift of z=3.07+/- 0.83 and with 10
        of the sources at z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 4. We find that at a
        fixed luminosity, the dust temperature is ̃5 K cooler than that
        expected from the \{T\}$_{d}$-\{L\}$_{\{\{IR}$\}\} relation at
        z\textbackslashquad {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 1, though different
        temperature selection effects should be taken into account. The
        radio-detected subsample (excluding three strong active galactic
        nucleus) follows the far-infrared (far-IR)/radio correlation at
        lower redshifts, and no evolution with redshift is observed out
        to z̃ 5, suggesting that the far-IR emission is star formation
        dominated. The contribution of the high-z Herschel 500
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m sources to the cosmic SFR density is
        comparable to that of (sub)millimeter galaxy populations at z̃
        2.5 and at least 40\% of the extinction-corrected UV samples at
        z̃ 4. Further investigation into the nature of these high-z
        dusty galaxies will be crucial for our understanding of the star
        formation histories and the buildup of stellar mass at the
        earliest cosmic epochs.}",

     abstract = "{Context. The advent of deep multiwavelength extragalactic surveys has
        led to the necessity for advanced and fast methods for
        photometric analysis. In fact, codes which allow analyses of the
        same regions of the sky observed at different wavelengths and
        resolutions are becoming essential to thoroughly exploit current
        and future data. In this context, a key issue is the confusion
        (i.e. blending) of sources in low-resolution images. <BR />
        Aims: We present t-phot, a publicly available software package
        developed within the astrodeep project. t-phot is aimed at
        extracting accurate photometry from low-resolution images, where
        the blending of sources can be a serious problem for the
        accurate and unbiased measurement of fluxes and colours. <BR />
        Methods: t-phot can be considered as the next generation to
        tfit, providing significant improvements over and above it and
        other similar codes (e.g. convphot). t-phot gathers data from a
        high-resolution image of a region of the sky, and uses this
        information (source positions and morphologies) to obtain priors
        for the photometric analysis of the lower resolution image of
        the same field. t-phot can handle different types of datasets as
        input priors, namely i) a list of objects that will be used to
        obtain cutouts from the real high-resolution image; ii) a set of
        analytical models (as .fits stamps); iii) a list of unresolved,
        point-like sources, useful for example for far-infrared (FIR)
        wavelength domains. <BR /> Results: By means of simulations and
        analysis of real datasets, we show that t-phot yields accurate
        estimations of fluxes within the intrinsic uncertainties of the
        method, when systematic errors are taken into account (which can
        be done thanks to a flagging code given in the output). t-phot
        is many times faster than similar codes like tfit and convphot
        (up to hundreds, depending on the problem and the method
        adopted), whilst at the same time being more robust and more
        versatile. This makes it an excellent choice for the analysis of
        large datasets. When used with the same parameter sets as for
        tfit it yields almost identical results (although in a much
        shorter time); in addition we show how the use of different
        settings and methods significantly enhances the performance. <BR
        /> Conclusions: t-phot proves to be a state-of-the-art tool for
        multiwavelength optical to far-infrared image photometry. Given
        its versatility and robustness, t-phot can be considered the
        preferred choice for combined photometric analysis of current
        and forthcoming extragalactic imaging surveys. t-phot is

        a sharp decrease at \&lt;100 kpc. After considering different
        potential explanations, we conclude that this is likely an
        environmental signature of the hot inner halo. This effect can
        be explained in the first order by a simple free-fall scenario,

        as follows: (i) the slope of the star-formation rate-M$_{*}$
        correlation is consistent with being constant ≃0.8 up to z ≃
        1.5, while its normalization keeps increasing with redshift;
        (ii) for the first time we are able to explore the FIR-radio
        correlation for a mass-selected sample of star-forming galaxies:
        the correlation does not evolve up to z ≃ 4; (iii) we confirm
        that galaxy stellar mass is a robust proxy for UV dust
        attenuation in star-forming galaxies, with more massive galaxies
        being more dust attenuated. Strikingly, we find that this
        attenuation relation evolves very weakly with redshift, with the
        amount of dust attenuation increasing by less than 0.3 mag over
        the redshift range [0.5-4] for a fixed stellar mass; (iv) the
        correlation between dust attenuation and the UV spectral slope
        evolves with redshift, with the median UV slope becoming bluer
        with redshift. By z ≃ 3, typical UV slopes are inconsistent,
        given the measured dust attenuations, with the predictions of
        commonly used empirical laws. (v) Finally, building on existing
        results, we show that gas reddening is marginally larger (by a
        factor of around 1.3) than the stellar reddening at all
        redshifts probed. Our results support a scenario where the ISM
        conditions of typical star-forming galaxies evolve with
        redshift, such that at z {\ensuremath{\geq}} 1.5 Main Sequence
        galaxies have ISM conditions moving closer to those of local

        497 individual far-infrared detections is supplemented by the
        stacking analysis of a mass complete sample of 62 361 star-
        forming galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) H band-
        selected catalogs of the CANDELS survey and from two deep
        ground-based K$_{s}$ band-selected catalogs in the GOODS-North
        and the COSMOS-wide field to obtain one of the most accurate and
        unbiased understanding to date of the stellar mass growth over
        the cosmic history. We show, for the first time, that stacking
        also provides a powerful tool to determine the dispersion of a
        physical correlation and describe our method called ``scatter
        stacking'', which may be easily generalized to other
        experiments. The combination of direct UV and far-infrared UV-
        reprocessed light provides a complete census on the star
        formation rates (SFRs), allowing us to demonstrate that galaxies
        at z = 4 to 0 of all stellar masses (M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$)
        follow a universal scaling law, the so-called main sequence of
        star-forming galaxies. We find a universal close-to-linear slope
        of the log $_{10}$(SFR)-log $_{10}$(M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$)
        relation, with evidence for a flattening of the main sequence at
        high masses (log $_{10}$(M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$/M$_{☉}$) \&gt;
        10.5) that becomesless prominent with increasing redshift and
        almost vanishes by z ≃ 2. This flattening may be due to the
        parallel stellar growth of quiescent bulges in star-forming
        galaxies, which mostly happens over the same redshift range.
        Within the main sequence, we measure a nonvarying SFR dispersion
        of 0.3 dex: at a fixed redshift and stellar mass, about 68\% of
        star-forming galaxies form stars at a universal rate within a
        factor 2. The specific SFR (sSFR = SFR/M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$)
        of star-forming galaxies is found to continuously increase from
        z = 0 to 4. Finally we discuss the implications of our findings
        on the cosmic SFR history and on the origin of present-day
        stars: more than two-thirds of present-day stars must have
        formed in a regime dominated by the ``main sequence'' mode. As a
        consequence we conclude that, although omnipresent in the
        distant Universe, galaxy mergers had little impact in shaping
        the global star formation history over the last 12.5 billion
        years. Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science

        The inhomogeneity of the intergalactic medium (IGM), however,
        causes significant deviation of the dispersion measure from that

        individual event. Fortunately, with sufficient FRBs along
        different sightlines but within a very narrow redshift interval
        (e.g., {\ensuremath{\Delta}}z ̃0.05), the mean obtained from
        averaging observed dispersion measures does not suffer such a
        problem and hence may be used as a cosmic probe. We show that in
        the optimistic case (e.g., about 20 FRBs in each
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}z have been measured; the most distant FRBs
        were at redshift {\ensuremath{\geq}}3; the host galaxies and the
        FRB sources contribute little to the detected dispersion
        measures) and with all the uncertainties (i.e., the
        inhomogeneity of the IGM, the contribution and uncertainty of
        host galaxies, and the evolution and error of f$_{IGM}$)
        considered, FRBs could help constrain the equation of state of

        the deepest available X-ray data from Chandra 4 Ms observations.
        This sample consists of 133 objects with the 3.6

        approximately complete for galaxies with M $_{*}$ \&gt;

        this sample into two types, quiescent and star-forming galaxies
        (SFGs), in the observed infrared color-color ([3.6]-[24] versus
        K - [3.6]) diagram. The further morphological study of this
        sample shows a consistent result with the observed color
        classification. The classified quiescent galaxies are bulge
        dominated and SFGs in the sample have disk or irregular
        morphologies. Our observed infrared color classification is also
        consistent with the rest-frame color (U - V versus V - J)
        classification. We also found that quiescent and SFGs are well
        separated in the nonparametric morphology parameter (Gini versus
        M $_{20}$) diagram measuring their concentration and clumpiness:
        quiescent galaxies have a Gini coefficient higher than 0.58 and
        SFGs have a Gini coefficient lower than 0.58. We argue that the
        star formation quenching process must lead to or be accompanied
        by the increasing galaxy concentration. One prominent
        morphological feature of this sample is that disks are commonly
        seen in this massive galaxy sample at 1.5 \&lt;= z \&lt;= 2.5:
        30\% of quiescent galaxies and 70\% of SFGs with M $_{*}$ \&gt;
        {}10$^{11}$ M $_{☉}$ have disks in their rest-frame optical
        morphologies. The prevalence of these extended, relatively

        as input parameters produces more accurate photo-z's than using
        colors; (2) The inclusion of 2MASS (J, H, K$_{s}$) bands does
        not improve photo-z's significantly, which indicates that near
        infrared data might not be important for the low-redshift
        sample; (3) Adding the concentration index (essentially the
        steepness of the galaxy brightness profile) as an extra input
        can improve the photo-z's estimation up to
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 10 percent; (4) Dividing the
        sample into early- and late-type galaxies by using the
        concentration index, normal and abnormal galaxies by using the
        emission line flux ratios, and red and blue galaxies by using
        color index (g - r), we can improve the accuracy of photo-z's
        significantly; (5) Our analysis shows that the outliers (where
        there is a big difference between the spectroscopic and
        photometric redshifts) are mainly correlated with galaxy types,
        e.g., most outliers are late-type (blue) galaxies.}",
